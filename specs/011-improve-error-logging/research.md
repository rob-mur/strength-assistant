# Research: Error Logging and Handling Improvements

## Current State Analysis

### Project Technology Stack
- **Language/Version**: TypeScript with React Native/Expo
- **Primary Dependencies**: Expo SDK, Supabase, Legend State, Jest, Maestro
- **Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Local AsyncStorage
- **Testing**: Jest (unit), Maestro (integration), React Native Testing Library
- **Target Platform**: Mobile (iOS/Android) + Web
- **Project Type**: Mobile application

### Silent Error Handling Patterns Found

**Empty Catch Blocks Identified**: 47 instances across the codebase

**Common Categories**:
1. **Storage Operations** (`asyncStorage.web.ts`): 4 empty catches for localStorage failures
2. **Data Synchronization** (`syncConfig.ts`): 5 empty catches for sync failures
3. **Supabase Operations** (`SupabaseExerciseRepo.ts`): 2 empty catches for database failures
4. **Persistence Operations** (`ExerciseService.ts`): 2 empty catches for data loading/saving

### Current Logging Infrastructure

**Existing Logging**:
- Basic console.log usage scattered throughout
- No centralized logging system
- No error categorization or structured logging
- Some files have comment-based silent error handling

**Dependencies Available**:
- React Native's built-in error handling
- `react-native-exception-handler` already installed (global error capture)
- Console API available across platforms

## Technology Decisions

### Decision: Logging System Architecture
**Chosen**: Centralized logging utility with severity levels
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error handling across all modules
- Supports standard severity classification (Critical, Error, Warning, Info, Debug)
- Can be enhanced later with remote logging services
- Maintains constitutional principle of direct framework usage (no heavy abstraction)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Third-party logging libraries (rejected: adds unnecessary complexity)
- Console-only approach (rejected: no severity classification or structure)

### Decision: Error Recovery Strategy
**Chosen**: Transient error retry with exponential backoff for network/I/O only
**Rationale**:
- Network and database operations are inherently unreliable
- User operations should provide feedback rather than silent failure
- Logic errors indicate bugs and should not be retried
- Aligns with constitutional principle of progressive validation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Retry all errors (rejected: would retry programming bugs)
- No retry mechanism (rejected: poor user experience for transient failures)

### Decision: Error Context Collection
**Chosen**: Standard diagnostic context per clarifications
**Rationale**:
- Timestamp, error message, stack trace provide technical debugging info
- User ID, operation, app state provide business context
- Balances debugging needs with performance impact
- Follows constitutional principle of test-driven development (logs enable better testing)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Minimal context only (rejected: insufficient for debugging)
- Comprehensive device metrics (rejected: privacy concerns and performance impact)

### Decision: User Error Communication
**Chosen**: Generic user messages with technical logging
**Rationale**:
- Protects technical implementation details from users
- Provides developers with full debugging information
- Maintains user experience while enabling developer productivity
- Follows constitutional principle of anonymous user testing (no sensitive data exposure)

### Decision: Environment Consistency
**Chosen**: Identical error handling across all environments
**Rationale**:
- Ensures production issues can be reproduced in development
- Simplifies testing and debugging
- Reduces environment-specific bugs
- Aligns with constitutional principle of local testing first (devbox consistency)

## Best Practices Research

### React Native Error Handling Patterns
1. **Global Error Boundaries**: Catch React component errors
2. **Unhandled Promise Rejection**: Use global handlers for async operations
3. **Native Exception Handling**: Platform-specific error capture
4. **Network Error Handling**: Timeout and retry strategies

### TypeScript Error Handling
1. **Type-safe error objects**: Use discriminated unions for error types
2. **Result pattern**: Return success/error objects instead of throwing
3. **Assertion functions**: Type guards for error state validation

### Supabase Error Patterns
1. **Database Errors**: Connection, constraint, and data errors
2. **Authentication Errors**: Token expiry, permissions, session issues
3. **Storage Errors**: File upload, download, and permission failures

### Testing Error Scenarios
1. **Unit Test Coverage**: Error paths must be tested
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end error flows via Maestro
3. **Contract Testing**: API error response validation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Central logging utility with severity levels
2. Error context collection mechanism
3. Generic user error messaging system
4. Constitutional compliance verification

### Phase 2: Silent Error Remediation
1. Systematic replacement of empty catch blocks
2. Categorization of errors by type (transient vs permanent)
3. Implementation of retry logic for appropriate errors
4. Enhanced error logging with full context

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. Unit tests for error handling paths
2. Integration tests for user error scenarios
3. Performance impact validation
4. Production deployment with monitoring

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality (constitutional requirement)
- Performance impact must be minimal
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Compatible with existing devbox development environment

### Testing Requirements
- All error paths must have corresponding tests
- Local testing must validate before CI/CD
- Anonymous user testing for production validation
- Progressive validation through all environments

### Integration Points
