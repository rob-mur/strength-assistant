-- Initial seed data for development
-- This file is run after migrations to populate the database with test data

-- Insert sample data only in development/test environments
-- Users will be created through authentication, so we don't seed user data
-- Exercises are user-scoped, so they will be created by users through the app

-- You can add sample data here if needed for development:
-- INSERT INTO exercises (name, user_id) VALUES 
-- ('Push-ups', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'),
-- ('Pull-ups', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'),
-- ('Squats', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
