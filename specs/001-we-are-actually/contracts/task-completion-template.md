## Constitutional Compliance (Amendment v2.6.0)

### Test Expectation Declaration (MANDATORY)
**Expected Test Outcome**: [PASS/FAIL]

**Reasoning**: [Detailed explanation of why you expect tests to pass or fail]
- What implementation changes were made?
- Which tests are likely to be affected?
- Are there any new test dependencies or requirements?
- Did you introduce any breaking changes?
- Are there any performance implications?

### Validation Execution (MANDATORY)
**Validation Command**: `devbox run test; echo "Exit code: $?"`

**Pre-Execution Checklist**:
- [ ] All files saved and staged
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] No syntax errors detected
- [ ] Memory constraints respected (sequential execution)

### Execution Results (Fill after running validation)
**Execution Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]  
**Exit Code**: [0 or 1]  
**Execution Time**: [X seconds]  
**Constitutional Compliance**: [PASS/FAIL]

**Test Output Summary**:
```
[Brief summary of test execution results]
- Total Tests: X
- Passed: X  
- Failed: X
- Skipped: X (should be 0 per Amendment v2.6.0)
- Memory Usage: X MB
```

**Full Output** (if needed for debugging):
```
[Complete output from devbox run test command]
```

## Prediction Accuracy Analysis

### Accuracy Assessment
**Prediction**: [CORRECT/INCORRECT]

**Analysis**: [If incorrect, analyze why the prediction was wrong]

- [Warning signs to watch for]
- [Testing patterns to remember]

## Performance Analysis

### Test Suite Performance
**Target**: <60 seconds (Amendment v2.6.0 requirement)  
**Actual**: [X seconds]  
**Performance Status**: [COMPLIANT/NON_COMPLIANT]

**Performance Breakdown** (if available):
- Setup Time: [X seconds]
- Test Execution: [X seconds]  
- Teardown Time: [X seconds]
- Memory Peak: [X MB]

### Performance Issues Identified
[List any performance issues discovered during validation]

### Optimization Opportunities
[List potential optimizations for future implementation]

## Constitutional Integration

### Amendment Compliance Checklist
- [ ] **Test Expectation Declaration**: Explicit PASS/FAIL prediction provided
- [ ] **Post-Task Validation**: `devbox run test` executed with exit code capture
- [ ] **Rapid Test Performance**: Test suite completed within 60-second target
- [ ] **Skip Pattern Prohibition**: No test skips without constitutional justification
- [ ] **Binary Exit Code Validation**: Amendment v2.5.0 compliance maintained
- [ ] **Test Governance**: Amendment v2.4.0 requirements satisfied

### Amendment Integration Status
**Amendment v2.5.0 Integration**: [COMPATIBLE/ISSUES_FOUND]
- Binary exit code validation: [WORKING/NEEDS_FIX]
- Exit code propagation: [WORKING/NEEDS_FIX]

**Amendment v2.4.0 Integration**: [COMPATIBLE/ISSUES_FOUND]  
- Test governance compliance: [WORKING/NEEDS_FIX]
- Constitutional framework: [WORKING/NEEDS_FIX]

### Violations and Corrections

**Constitutional Violations Found**:
[List any violations of constitutional requirements]

**Corrective Actions Taken**:
[List actions taken to address violations]

**Outstanding Issues**:
[List any unresolved constitutional compliance issues]

## Implementation Impact

### Files Modified
- [List all files changed during this task]

### Tests Affected
- [List tests that were impacted by changes]

### Performance Impact
**Positive Impacts**:
- [Performance improvements made]

**Negative Impacts**:
- [Any performance regressions introduced]

### Memory Impact
- Memory usage change: [+/- X MB]
- Memory optimization opportunities: [List any identified]
- Constitutional memory constraint compliance: [MAINTAINED/VIOLATED]

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] [Any immediate follow-up tasks]

## Template Usage Notes

### When to Use This Template
- âœ… Every task completion (no exceptions)
- âœ… Before marking any task as complete
- âœ… After any significant code change
- âœ… When updating task tracking systems

### Constitutional Requirements
- ðŸ”´ **MANDATORY**: Test expectation declaration
- ðŸ”´ **MANDATORY**: Post-task validation execution
- ðŸ”´ **MANDATORY**: Performance verification
