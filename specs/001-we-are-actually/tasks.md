## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Each task includes constitutional validation per Amendment v2.6.0

---

## Phase 3.1: P0 Foundation Stability (Blocks All Testing)

### Task Completion Validation (Amendment v2.6.0)
**Expected Test Outcome**: FAIL initially - Jest worker exceptions prevent stable test execution
**Reasoning**: Foundation issues must be resolved before any tests can run reliably

- [x] T001 [P] âœ… Jest worker configuration optimized + **CRITICAL EXIT CODE FIX** in `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/jest.config.js` + `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/scripts/test.sh`
  - âœ… `maxWorkers: 1` configured for React Native + dual backend stability
  - âœ… `testTimeout: 8000` optimized for constitutional performance (faster than originally planned)
  - âœ… `detectOpenHandles: false` disabled for speed - constitutional monitoring handles resource detection
  - âœ… `forceExit: true` configured to prevent hanging processes
  - âœ… Constitutional Amendment v2.6.0 optimizations already applied
  - ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Fixed devbox exit code propagation - test failures now correctly return exit code 1 (was returning 0 despite failures)
  - âœ… Constitutional Amendment v2.5.0 Binary Exit Code Enforcement now functional

- [x] T002 [P] âœ… Jest global setup completed in `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/jest.setup.js`
  - âœ… Memory management configuration with optimization settings (lines 122-157)
  - âœ… Proper test environment initialization with Firebase/Supabase mocks (lines 52-98)
  - âœ… React Native animation mocking added to prevent act() warnings (lines 40-72)
  - âœ… Cleanup between test suites configured (lines 147-170)
  - âœ… Global test utilities setup and error handling implemented

### Constitutional Validation Checkpoint P0
**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - Jest worker exceptions eliminated, foundation stable  
**Validation Command**: `devbox run test 2>&1 | grep -i "worker\|child process\|exception" | wc -l` (should be 0)

---

## Phase 3.1: **P1 Core Test Fixes (Focus on Biggest Impact)**

### Task Completion Validation (Amendment v2.6.0)  
**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - High-impact test fixes should dramatically reduce failure count
**Reasoning**: Focus on the most common failure patterns first for maximum impact

- [x] **T003 [SMALL] âœ… AuthAwareLayout component test timeouts FIXED** in `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/__tests__/components/AuthAwareLayout-test.tsx`
  - âœ… **Scope**: Single file fix - reduced from 60s timeout to 2.1s execution
  - âœ… **Impact**: 18/18 tests passing, 96% performance improvement
  - âœ… **Method**: Replaced waitFor() with direct assertions, proper act() wrapping
  - âœ… **Lines**: 15 lines changed - maximum impact with minimal scope

- [ ] **T004 [SMALL] Integration test assertion failures - STABILIZED** in `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/__tests__/integration/feature-flag-migration.test.ts`
  - âœ… **PARTIAL SUCCESS**: Fixed major authentication assertion mismatches + added missing methods  
  - âœ… **Progress**: 4/11 integration tests now passing (significant improvement)
  - âœ… **FIXED**: Pre-test TypeScript errors resolved - removed duplicate method definitions
  - âœ… **IMPROVED**: signInAnonymously now returns proper anonymous user (isAnonymous: true)
  - ðŸ”„ **Current Status**: Tests running cleanly, ready to address remaining ~7 test failures
  - **Next**: Complete the remaining integration test expectation mismatches (performance, environment)

**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - Component tests execute without timeouts or act() warnings
**Validation Command**: `npm test -- __tests__/components/ 2>&1 | grep -i "act\|timeout\|update.*test" | wc -l` (should be 0)

---

## Phase 3.4: P3 Test Quality (Improves Reliability)

## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies (Must Complete in Order)
- **P0 Foundation** (T001-T003) â†’ **P1 Backend** (T004-T007) â†’ **P2 Components** (T008-T011) â†’ **P3 Quality** (T012-T014) â†’ **Final Validation** (T015-T016)
- Each priority phase must achieve constitutional checkpoint before proceeding

### Parallel Execution Within Priority Levels
```bash
# Phase P0 - Run in parallel:
Task: "Optimize Jest worker configuration in jest.config.js"
Task: "Create Jest global setup in jest.setup.js" 
Task: "Create test environment stabilization helper in lib/test-utils/TestEnvironmentManager.ts"

# Phase P1 - Run in parallel:
Task: "Create Supabase test client factory in lib/test-utils/TestSupabaseClientFactory.ts"
Task: "Create Firebase mock consistency layer in lib/test-utils/FirebaseMockFactory.ts"
Task: "Create component test utilities in lib/test-utils/ComponentTestUtils.ts"
```

## Constitutional Compliance Framework

### Amendment v2.6.0 Requirements
Each task completion MUST include:

1. **Pre-Completion Declaration** (included above for each phase)
2. **Validation Execution**: `devbox run test; echo "Exit code: $?"`
3. **Results Documentation**: PASS/FAIL with exit code, execution time, prediction accuracy

### Binary Exit Code Enforcement (Amendment v2.5.0)
- Exit code 0 = Constitutional compliance achieved
- Exit code 1 = Constitutional violation, systematic repair continues
- NO partial success acceptance per constitutional requirements

### Performance Monitoring
- Target: <60 seconds total execution time
- Current baseline: ~84 seconds (requires optimization in T001-T002)
- Performance tracking required per Amendment v2.6.0

---

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run parallel
- Constitutional validation checkpoints are mandatory gates
- Each task must achieve expected outcome before proceeding
- Exit code 0 from `devbox run test` is the ultimate success criterion
- All 122 failing tests must be systematically repaired per Amendment v2.4.0
