# Quickstart: Remove Invalid Validation Step from Production Build

## Validation Steps

This quickstart validates that the production build workflow fix works correctly by testing both automatic and manual triggering scenarios.

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with current failing production build workflow
- EXPO_TOKEN secret properly configured
- android-build action available in repository

### Test Scenario 1: Automatic Production Build Trigger

1. **Create test change**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-production-build-fix
   echo "// Test change for production build fix - $(date)" >> lib/test-production-fix.ts
   git add . && git commit -m "test: validate production build fix"
   ```

2. **Merge to main**:

   ```bash
   # Create PR and merge to main via GitHub UI or:
   git checkout main
   git merge test-production-build-fix
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify production build success**:
   - Check that `Build Production APK` workflow triggers on main push
   - Confirm workflow completes without validation errors
   - Verify no "validate-main" job appears in workflow execution
   - Confirm production APK is built successfully
   - Verify GitHub release is created with APK attachment

4. **Expected outcomes**:
   - ✅ Production build triggers immediately on main push
   - ✅ No validation step that references typecheck/lint commands
   - ✅ APK build completes successfully
   - ✅ GitHub release created with correct naming convention

### Test Scenario 2: Manual Production Build Trigger

1. **Trigger manual build**:

   ```bash
   gh workflow run "Build Production APK"
   ```

2. **Verify manual execution**:
   - Check that workflow runs immediately when manually triggered
   - Confirm same build and release steps execute
   - Verify no validation dependencies cause delays
   - Confirm APK and release creation works identically

3. **Expected outcomes**:
   - ✅ Manual workflow dispatch works immediately
   - ✅ Same simplified workflow structure applies
   - ✅ No validation step failures occur

### Test Scenario 3: Workflow Structure Verification

1. **Verify workflow simplification**:

   ```bash
   # Check current workflow structure
   cat .github/workflows/build-production.yml

   # Verify no validate-main job exists
   grep -q "validate-main" .github/workflows/build-production.yml && echo "❌ Validation job still present" || echo "✅ Validation job removed"

   # Verify direct build execution
   grep -q "needs: validate-main" .github/workflows/build-production.yml && echo "❌ Build still depends on validation" || echo "✅ Build executes directly"
   ```

2. **Expected outcomes**:
   - ✅ No validate-main job definition in workflow
   - ✅ Build job has no dependency on validate-main
   - ✅ Workflow contains only essential build and release steps

### Test Scenario 4: Error Resolution Verification

1. **Verify error conditions are resolved**:
   - Check workflow history for previous failures due to typecheck command
   - Confirm latest runs complete without command not found errors
   - Verify production builds can now succeed consistently

2. **Expected outcomes**:
   - ✅ No more failures due to missing typecheck command
   - ✅ Production builds complete successfully
   - ✅ Workflow execution time reduced (no validation overhead)

### Success Criteria

All test scenarios must pass with the following behaviors:

- Production build triggers on main push without validation step
- Manual production builds work via workflow_dispatch
- No references to unsupported commands (typecheck, lint) in production workflow
- APK building and GitHub release creation continues to work correctly
- Workflow execution is simplified and focused on core purpose

### Rollback Plan

If the fix causes issues:

1. Restore original workflow structure: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. Add back validate-main job if needed for other dependencies
3. Fix underlying command availability if validation is actually required
4. Push revert to main branch to restore working state
