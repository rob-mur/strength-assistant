# Test: REAL Airplane Mode - Device Network Disconnection
# Purpose: Test actual device network disconnection (not app simulation)
# 
# IMPORTANT: This test requires REAL airplane mode - not app simulation
# The device must actually lose internet connectivity

- launchApp

# Wait for app to load
- assertVisible:
    text: "Workout"

# Navigate to exercises
- tapOn:
    text: "Exercises"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Exercises"

# STEP 1: User instruction to enable airplane mode
- tapOn:
    text: "Settings"
- assertVisible:
    text: "ENABLE AIRPLANE MODE NOW"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Turn on airplane mode on your device, then tap Continue"
- tapOn:
    text: "Continue"

# STEP 2: Verify app detects real network disconnection
# The app should detect the actual network state change
- tapOn:
    text: "Exercises"

# Wait for network state detection
- wait: 2000

# The sync status should show offline (detecting real network state)
- assertVisible:
    id: "sync-status-offline"

# STEP 3: Create exercises while ACTUALLY offline

# Verify sync status shows pending operations (due to real offline state)
- assertVisible:

# STEP 4: User instruction to disable airplane mode
- tapOn:
    text: "Settings"
- assertVisible:
    text: "DISABLE AIRPLANE MODE NOW"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Turn off airplane mode on your device, then tap Continue"

# STEP 5: Verify app detects real network restoration
- tapOn:
    text: "Exercises"

# Wait for network detection and auto-sync
- wait: 5000

# App should detect real network restoration
- assertVisible:
    id: "sync-status-synced"

# Exercises should still be visible after sync
- assertVisible:
    text: "Real Offline Exercise 1"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Real Offline Exercise 2"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Real Offline Exercise 3"

# STEP 6: CRITICAL TEST - App restart with real network available
- terminateApp
- launchApp

# Navigate to exercises
- tapOn:
    text: "Exercises"

# CRITICAL ASSERTION: Exercises must survive real network disconnection + restart
- assertVisible:

- assertVisible:

# STEP 7: Test edge case - Turn airplane mode on AGAIN while exercises exist

- assertVisible:
