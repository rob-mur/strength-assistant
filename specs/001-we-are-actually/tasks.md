## Dependencies (Sequential Chain)
```
Setup: T001 → T002 → T003
Infrastructure: T003 → T004 → T005 → T006 → T007 → T008 → T009
Contracts: T009 → T010 → T011 → T012 → T013 → T014 → T015 → T016
Integration: T016 → T017 → T018 → T019 → T020
Gate: T020 → T021 (MANDATORY PASS)
Models: T021 → T022 → T023 → T024
Services: T024 → T025 → T026 → T027 → T028
Features: T028 → T029 → T030
Constitution: T030 → T031 → T032 → T033 → T034
UI: T034 → T035 → T036 → T037
Migration: T037 → T038 → T039 → T040
Validation: T040 → T041 → T042 → T043 → T044 → T045
```

## Sequential Execution Example
```bash
# NEVER parallel - memory safety first
# Task T001: Fix test script exit codes
Task: "Update scripts/test.sh to properly propagate binary exit codes"
# Wait for completion, verify success
echo "Exit code: $?"
# Continue to T002 only if T001 succeeded
```

## Critical Success Criteria
- [ ] `devbox run test` returns exit code 0 (verified with `echo "Exit code: $?"`)
- [ ] **`devbox run test` completes in <60 seconds** (performance requirement)
- [ ] All 80+ tests pass consistently without memory issues
- [ ] Constitutional Amendment v2.5.0 fully implemented and enforced
- [ ] Local-first operations respond in <50ms
- [ ] Seamless Firebase to Supabase migration capability
- [ ] Zero test regressions in main branch

## Constitutional Amendment v2.5.0 Compliance
**Binary Exit Code Enforcement**:
- **T001, T021, T042**: Implement and validate exit code checking
- **ALL test validation**: Must check exit codes, never parse logs
- **Constitutional gate**: T021 blocks all feature work until exit code 0
- **Final validation**: T042 ensures complete compliance

## Memory Management Protocol
- **Sequential execution only**: No parallel tasks to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Memory monitoring**: Check usage before/after each task
- **Emergency protocol**: Stop if approaching 32GB system limit
- **Garbage collection**: Force GC between memory-intensive tasks

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: 7 contract files → 7 contract test tasks (T010-T016)
2. **From Data Model**: 3 entities → 3 model tasks + services (T022-T024, T025-T028)
3. **From Research**: Memory/constitution decisions → infrastructure tasks (T001-T009)
4. **From Quickstart**: User scenarios → integration tests (T017-T020)

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T010-T016)
- [x] All entities have model implementation tasks (T022-T024)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2-3.3 → 3.5+)
- [x] Sequential execution enforced (no parallel markers)
- [x] Exit code validation mandatory (T001, T021, T042)
- [x] Constitutional compliance prioritized (Amendment v2.5.0)
- [x] Memory constraints addressed throughout
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path

**TOTAL TASKS**: 45 sequential tasks  
**ESTIMATED DURATION**: 25-30 hours  
**CRITICAL PATH**: T001→T021 (constitutional gate)→T042 (final validation)

3. 📝 **Follow sequential order** - T010→T016 (contracts) then T017→T020 (integration)
4. ⚠️ **TDD Required** - Write failing tests before implementing features
5. 🚀 **Ready for feature work** - All infrastructure exists for Local First Storage development
