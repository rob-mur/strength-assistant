---

## Phase 4.1: P4 High-Impact Service Contract Fixes

### Task Completion Validation (Amendment v2.6.0)

**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - Service contract completion will unlock cascade of contract tests
**Reasoning**: Missing sync methods block most contract test validation

- [ ] **T031 [HIGH IMPACT: ~15 tests] ExerciseService Missing Sync Methods**
  - **Root Cause**: Contract tests expect `markSyncError()`, `markSyncCompleted()`, `getFailedSyncs()` methods missing from ExerciseService
  - **Affected Areas**: `__tests__/contracts/exercise-crud-contract.test.ts`, `__tests__/contracts/storage-backend-contract.test.ts`
  - **Fix Strategy**: Add missing sync status management methods to ExerciseService class
  - **Cascade Impact**: Will unlock most contract tests - highest ROI fix
  - **Files**: `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/lib/data/ExerciseService.ts`

- [ ] **T032 [HIGH IMPACT: ~12 tests] Firebase/Supabase Mock Channel Methods**
  - **Root Cause**: Mock implementations missing `channel()`, `onSnapshot()`, `unsubscribe()` methods for real-time subscriptions
  - **Affected Areas**: `__tests__/contracts/storage-interface.test.ts`, `__tests__/contracts/supabase-auth-contract.test.ts`, `__tests__/data/supabase/SupabaseClient-test.ts`
  - **Fix Strategy**: Enhance mock implementations with complete real-time subscription API
  - **Critical Impact**: Unblocks all real-time subscription contract tests
  - **Files**: `jest.setup.js` (Supabase mocks), `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/lib/test-utils/FirebaseMockFactory.ts`

### Constitutional Validation Checkpoint P4.1

**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - Contract tests achieve >90% pass rate
**Validation**: Contract test suites should show dramatic improvement after T031-T032

---

## Phase 4.2: P4 Integration Test Format Fixes

### Task Completion Validation (Amendment v2.6.0)

**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - Integration tests achieve consistent format contracts
**Reasoning**: TestDevice/TestApp format mismatches are systematic and fixable

- [ ] **T033 [MEDIUM IMPACT: ~10 tests] Exercise Format Contract Mismatches**
  - **Root Cause**: TestDevice operations return basic Exercise objects, tests expect `createdAt`/`updatedAt` as Date objects + `syncStatus`
  - **Affected Areas**: `__tests__/integration/anonymous-local-first.test.ts` (multiple test failures)
  - **Fix Strategy**: Update TestDevice exercise CRUD methods to return proper format with sync metadata
  - **Integration Impact**: Fixes most integration test failures around exercise operations
  - **Files**: `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/lib/test-utils/TestDevice.ts`

- [ ] **T034 [MEDIUM IMPACT: ~8 tests] TestApp Restart State Persistence**
  - **Root Cause**: `testApp.restart()` loses user state and exercises, but tests expect persistence across restarts
  - **Affected Areas**: Anonymous user persistence tests, exercise persistence across restart tests
  - **Fix Strategy**: Implement proper state serialization/deserialization in TestApp restart functionality
  - **Critical Impact**: Essential for integration test restart scenarios
  - **Files**: `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/lib/test-utils/TestApp.ts`

### Constitutional Validation Checkpoint P4.2

**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - Integration tests achieve >95% pass rate
**Validation**: `__tests__/integration/` test suites should be nearly fully passing

---

## Phase 4.3: P4 Final Quality Cleanup

### Task Completion Validation (Amendment v2.6.0)

**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - All remaining edge cases resolved
**Reasoning**: Final cleanup of timing and mock precision issues

- [ ] **T035 [LOW IMPACT: ~6 tests] Timestamp Precision Mismatches**
  - **Root Cause**: Tests comparing `new Date().toISOString()` with slightly different timestamps due to execution timing
  - **Affected Areas**: `__tests__/hooks/useExercises-test.tsx`
  - **Fix Strategy**: Use fixed timestamps or time mocking for consistent test behavior
  - **Quick Win**: Straightforward timing issue resolution
  - **Files**: `__tests__/hooks/useExercises-test.tsx`

- [ ] **T036 [MEDIUM IMPACT: ~10 tests] SupabaseExerciseRepo Mock Integration**
  - **Root Cause**: Mock setup for `exercises$` store and `syncExerciseToSupabase` not properly integrated with test expectations
  - **Affected Areas**: `__tests__/repo/SupabaseExerciseRepo-test.ts`
  - **Fix Strategy**: Align mock behavior with actual repository implementation patterns
  - **Repository Impact**: Completes repository-level test coverage
  - **Files**: `__tests__/repo/SupabaseExerciseRepo-test.ts`, related mock setups

### Constitutional Validation Checkpoint P4.3

**Expected Test Outcome**: PASS - 100% test pass rate achieved (exit code 0)
**Validation**: `devbox run test; echo "Exit code: $?"` should return 0
