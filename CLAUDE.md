## Architecture Overview

### Project Structure
This is a React Native Expo app built with TypeScript, using file-based routing and Firebase for data persistence.

#### Key Directories
- `app/` - File-based routing with Expo Router, contains screens and navigation
- `lib/` - Core application logic
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `models/` - TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `repo/` - Data access layer with repository pattern
  - `data/firebase/` - Firebase configuration and utilities
  - `locales/` - Internationalization files
- `__tests__/` - Unit tests
- `stories/` - Storybook stories for components

### Navigation Structure
- Tab-based navigation using `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`
- Main tabs: Home, Exercises, Workout
- Exercises tab has nested navigation with index and add screens

### Data Layer
- **Repository Pattern**: `ExerciseRepo` class provides data access abstraction
- **Dual Backend Support**: Firebase (current) and Supabase (migration target) with feature flag control
- **Legend State Integration**: Local-first persistence with automatic sync engine for Supabase
- **Models**: Simple `Exercise` interface with id and name fields
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses Firebase `onSnapshot` and Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime switching between Firebase and Supabase implementations

### State Management
- Custom hooks pattern (e.g., `useExercises`, `useAddExercise`)
- React hooks for local state management
- Firebase handles persistence and real-time sync

### Platform Configuration
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to project root for cleaner imports
- **Firebase**: Separate configs for web (`firebase.web.ts`) and native (`firebase.native.ts`)
- **Cross-platform**: Supports Android, iOS, and web deployment

### Theme and Styling
- Uses React Native Paper for Material Design 3 components
- Automatic light/dark theme switching based on system preference
- Custom fonts: JetBrains Mono and Noto Sans

### Testing Strategy
- Jest with React Native Testing Library for unit tests
- Component tests in `__tests__/components/`
- Hook tests in `__tests__/hooks/`
- Screen tests in `__tests__/screens/`
- Integration testing capability (config referenced)

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with custom path mapping
- **ESLint**: Expo config with additional plugins for unused imports, Storybook, Jest, and Testing Library
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Storybook**: Component development and documentation
- **Devbox (Nix)**: Reproducible development environment with lock file for CI/local parity

## üö® CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### TypeScript Testing Infrastructure (Amendment v2.2.0)
- **TypeScript Compilation**: MUST succeed before test execution (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- **devbox run test**: MUST pass completely before any commit
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically validate TypeScript compilation and block violating commits
- **Zero Tolerance**: No exceptions for TypeScript compilation failures
- **FORBIDDEN**: Committing code that breaks TypeScript compilation
- **REQUIRED**: Immediate fix of any TypeScript compilation errors

### TypeScript Validation Workflow
1. **Before Starting Work**: Run `devbox run test` to ensure clean baseline
2. **During Development**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` frequently to catch errors early
3. **Before Committing**: Pre-commit hook automatically validates TypeScript + tests
4. **CI/CD Validation**: `scripts/validate-typescript.sh` enforces constitutional compliance

### TypeScript Error Resolution Protocol
- **Immediate Action**: Fix TypeScript errors as soon as they appear
- **No Deferring**: Cannot push/merge code with TypeScript compilation errors
- **Validation Tools**:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` - Quick compilation check
  - `scripts/validate-typescript.sh` - Full constitutional compliance validation
  - Jest global setup - Validates TypeScript before test execution
  - Pre-commit hooks - Blocks commits with TypeScript errors

### Constitutional Amendment Infrastructure
- **Amendment Manager**: `src/constitution/ConstitutionalAmendmentManager.ts`
- **TypeScript Validator**: `src/typescript/TypeScriptValidator.ts`
- **Compliance Validation**: Automated constitutional requirement checking
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Pre-commit hooks, CI pipelines, Jest global setup

## üö® CURRENT CRITICAL STATUS (Amendment v2.3.0)

### Test Suite Constitutional Violation
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: `devbox run test` is NOT passing, violating the constitutional requirement that "devbox run test MUST pass completely before any commit"

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation validation working (constitutional check passes)
- ‚ùå **80+ Jest tests failing** - this blocks all constitutional compliance
- ‚ùå Missing test infrastructure: `TestDevice` and `TestApp` classes
- ‚ùå Component test timeouts in `AuthAwareLayout` tests
- üö® **Cannot commit until all tests pass**

**Required Actions**:
1. **Priority 1**: Implement missing `lib/test-utils/TestDevice.ts`
2. **Priority 1**: Implement missing `lib/test-utils/TestApp.ts`  
3. **Priority 2**: Fix component test timeout issues
4. **Priority 3**: Ensure `devbox run test` passes 100%

**Test Infrastructure Contracts**: Available in `specs/001-we-are-actually/contracts/`
- `test-infrastructure.ts` - TestDevice interface specification
- `jest-validation.ts` - Jest validation requirements
- `test-repair.ts` - Systematic test repair tracking

### Amendment v2.3.0: Enhanced Test Governance
Extends constitutional requirements to include:
- **Jest Test Passage**: All Jest tests MUST pass before commits
- **Test Infrastructure Requirements**: Missing test utilities must be implemented before dependent tests
- **Systematic Repair Tracking**: All failing tests must be catalogued and systematically repaired
- **Zero Test Regressions**: No new failing tests allowed in main branch

### Amendment v2.4.0: Comprehensive Test Governance & Enforcement (ACTIVE)
**Enacted**: 2025-01-15 | **Effective Immediately**

#### Mandatory Test Governance Requirements
- **Complete Test Suite Success**: `devbox run test` MUST achieve 100% pass rate (80/80 tests) before ANY commit to main branch
- **Pre-commit Enforcement**: Git pre-commit hooks MUST block commits when any test fails
- **CI/CD Pipeline Blocking**: Continuous integration MUST block deployments and merges on test failures
- **Test Infrastructure Completeness**: All test utilities (`TestDevice`, mock factories, test builders) MUST be fully implemented and functional
- **Systematic Repair Protocol**: Test failures MUST be catalogued, categorized, and repaired using tracked, prioritized approach

#### Constitutional Enforcement Mechanisms
1. **Pre-commit Validation**:
   - Husky pre-commit hooks execute `devbox run test` before allowing commits
   - Commits blocked with clear error messaging when tests fail
   - Developers MUST fix failing tests before commit proceeds

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - GitHub Actions (or equivalent) pipeline runs `devbox run test` as mandatory gate
   - Deployments blocked when test suite fails
   - Pull requests cannot be merged until all tests pass

3. **Test Infrastructure Validation**:
   - Missing test utilities (TestDevice, mock factories) trigger immediate implementation requirement
   - Test infrastructure MUST support both local and CI environments
   - All mocks MUST implement complete interfaces with TypeScript validation

4. **Regression Prevention**:
   - Automated monitoring for new test failures
   - Constitutional violation reporting for governance breaches
   - Zero tolerance policy for test regressions in main branch

#### Exemption Process (Emergency Use Only)
- **Authority**: Only repository maintainers can grant test exemptions
- **Duration**: Maximum 24-hour exemption periods
- **Justification**: MUST include critical business justification and repair timeline
- **Documentation**: All exemptions MUST be logged with constitutional violation reports

#### Constitutional Violation Consequences
- **Level 1** (Test Failure): Immediate commit blocking, repair required before proceeding
- **Level 2** (Infrastructure Missing): Development blocked until infrastructure implemented
- **Level 3** (Governance Bypass): Constitutional review and potential policy updates required

#### Success Validation
Constitutional compliance achieved when:
- ‚úÖ All 80 tests pass consistently (`devbox run test` = 100% success)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks actively prevent failing test commits
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline blocks deployments on test failures  
- ‚úÖ Test infrastructure fully implemented and documented
- ‚úÖ Systematic repair tracking operational and maintained

**ENFORCEMENT STATUS**: ACTIVE - All constitutional requirements in effect immediately
