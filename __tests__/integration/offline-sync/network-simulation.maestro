# Test: Network Simulation - Offline Sync Behavior
# Purpose: Test offline sync using app-controlled network simulation
# 
# This test uses the app's network simulation features for automated testing
# without requiring manual airplane mode toggling

- launchApp

# Look for developer/network simulation options
# Note: This assumes the app has debug/testing network controls
