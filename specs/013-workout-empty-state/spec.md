# Feature Specification: Workout Empty State Message

**Feature Branch**: `013-workout-empty-state`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "workout screen Initial message: when no exercise has yet been selected, the workout screen shouldn't show an empty card for the selected exercise, but rather a simple message indicating the user needs to select an exercise to get started"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Initial Workout Guidance (Priority: P1)

When a user opens the workout screen for the first time or when no exercise has been selected, they should receive clear guidance on how to begin their workout instead of seeing confusing empty interface elements.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical first-use experience that determines whether users understand how to start using the workout feature. Poor initial guidance leads to user confusion and abandonment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the workout screen with no exercise selected and verifying helpful guidance message appears instead of empty card.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on workout screen with no exercise selected, **When** they view the main workout area, **Then** they see a clear message instructing them to select an exercise to get started
2. **Given** user has previously selected exercises but none currently selected, **When** they return to workout screen, **Then** they see the guidance message instead of empty card
3. **Given** user sees the guidance message, **When** they read it, **Then** the message clearly explains the next action needed (selecting an exercise)
