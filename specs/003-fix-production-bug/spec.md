# Feature Specification: Fix Production Authentication Bug & Implement Release Testing

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-production-bug`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "fix production bug - currently the production build apk is having auth issues with the live server. We need to fix this, but on top I would like to find a way that we could have tested this before it was released"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Production APK has auth issues with live server
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: end users, developers, QA team
   ‚Üí Actions: authenticate, build APK, deploy, test before release
   ‚Üí Data: auth credentials, server endpoints, build configurations
   ‚Üí Constraints: production environment compatibility
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific auth error symptoms not described]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: "live server" could mean staging, production, or both]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: install production APK ‚Üí attempt login ‚Üí success/failure
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Fix auth bug, implement pre-release testing
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí User credentials, auth tokens, server endpoints, build artifacts
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific auth error details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Users who download and install the production APK should be able to authenticate successfully with the live server without encountering authentication failures that work in development but fail in production builds.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has the production APK installed, **When** they enter valid credentials and attempt to log in, **Then** authentication succeeds and they access the app normally
2. **Given** a developer creates a production build, **When** they run pre-release authentication tests, **Then** any auth configuration issues are detected before release
3. **Given** the QA team receives a production candidate build, **When** they run the automated test suite against live/staging servers, **Then** authentication flows are verified to work correctly
4. **Given** a production build is ready for release, **When** the release process runs, **Then** authentication compatibility is confirmed before distribution

### Edge Cases

- What happens when auth tokens have different expiration behavior in production vs development?
- How does the system handle network timeout differences between development and production environments?
- What occurs when production builds use different certificate pinning or security configurations?
- How are auth errors reported when they occur only in production builds?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST successfully authenticate users in production APK builds using the same credentials that work in development
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide clear error messages when authentication fails, distinguishing between credential issues and configuration problems
- **FR-003**: Development team MUST be able to test authentication against live/staging servers before releasing production builds
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain authentication state consistently between development and production builds
- **FR-005**: Release process MUST include automated verification that authentication works in production build configuration
- **FR-006**: System MUST log authentication attempts and failures in production builds for debugging purposes
- **FR-007**: Pre-release testing MUST validate authentication flows against [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which server environments - staging, pre-prod, or live production?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle authentication timeouts and network issues gracefully in production builds
- **FR-009**: Production builds MUST use the same authentication endpoints and protocols as development builds unless explicitly configured otherwise

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User Credentials**: Username/email and password combinations, authentication tokens, session data
- **Server Endpoints**: Authentication service URLs, API endpoints, certificate configurations
- **Build Artifacts**: APK files, configuration files, environment-specific settings
- **Test Results**: Authentication test outcomes, error logs, performance metrics
- **Release Pipeline**: Build stages, testing checkpoints, deployment gates
