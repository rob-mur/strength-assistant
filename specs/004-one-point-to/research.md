# Research: Production Server Testing Enhancement

## Overview

Research into implementing simple APK-based production validation after terraform deployment, reusing existing Maestro test flows with SKIP_DATA_CLEANUP environment variable modification.

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Maestro Integration for Production Testing

**Decision**: Reuse existing Maestro flow files for production validation

**Rationale**:

- Maestro flows already validate critical application functionality
- Existing flows are proven and maintained
- No need to duplicate test logic or create new test scenarios
- Reduces maintenance overhead

**Alternatives considered**:

- Creating new production-specific test flows (rejected: unnecessary duplication)
- Manual testing against production (rejected: not scalable or reliable)
- Using different test framework (rejected: adds complexity)

### 2. Anonymous User Strategy

**Decision**: Create fresh anonymous users for each test run

**Rationale**:

- Eliminates data persistence and cleanup concerns
- Removes security risks from credential management
- Simplifies test isolation without affecting real user data
- Anonymous users have limited privileges by design

**Alternatives considered**:

- Dedicated test user accounts with cleanup (rejected: complex cleanup logic)
- Mock users (rejected: wouldn't test real production authentication)
- Shared test accounts (rejected: data contamination risk)

### 3. Pipeline Integration Approach

**Decision**: Run production validation after terraform deployment but before frontend deployment

**Rationale**:

- Tests against actual deployed infrastructure with exact production configuration
- Validates terraform deployment success before exposing to users
- Enables infrastructure rollback if validation fails
- Separates infrastructure validation from application deployment

**Alternatives considered**:

- Pre-deployment validation (rejected: can't test actual deployed infrastructure)
- Post-frontend deployment (rejected: users would see issues first)
- During terraform deployment (rejected: adds complexity to infrastructure deployment)

### 4. Failure Handling and Error Reporting

**Decision**: Manual intervention - alert team and block frontend deployment, require manual rollback decision

**Rationale**:

- Allows human judgment on infrastructure vs application issues
- Prevents accidental rollbacks due to transient issues
- Provides opportunity to analyze logs before rollback decision
- Simpler to implement than automated rollback logic

**Alternatives considered**:

- Automatic infrastructure rollback (rejected: complex to implement safely)
- Warning-only mode (rejected: doesn't prevent problematic deployments)
- Silent failure logging (rejected: issues might go unnoticed)

### 5. Performance and Timeout Considerations

**Decision**: No specific timeout requirements, leverage Maestro's built-in timeouts

**Rationale**:

- Maestro flows already designed to be fast
- Existing timeout handling is proven
- Production tests should complete quickly by nature
- Avoids arbitrary timeout values

**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom timeout configuration (rejected: adds unnecessary complexity)
- Extended timeouts for production (rejected: would slow pipeline)
- No timeouts (rejected: could hang pipeline indefinitely)

### 6. Test Isolation and Production Impact

**Decision**: Use production server with anonymous users for true environment testing

**Rationale**:

- Tests actual production configuration and connectivity
- Anonymous users have minimal impact on production metrics
- Validates real network conditions and server behavior
- Catches environment-specific issues that staging might miss

**Alternatives considered**:

- Production-like staging environment (rejected: not identical to production)
- Read-only production access (rejected: doesn't test full functionality)
- Separate production test instance (rejected: not true production validation)

## Key Findings

1. **Reuse Strategy**: Existing Maestro flows provide complete test coverage without duplication
2. **User Management**: Anonymous users eliminate complexity while maintaining isolation
3. **Pipeline Position**: Final stage placement ensures quality gates while maintaining efficiency
4. **Error Reporting**: Standard CI/CD error reporting sufficient with production context
5. **Performance**: Maestro's existing performance characteristics meet requirements

## Next Steps

Phase 1 will design:

- CI/CD pipeline stage configuration for production validation
- Anonymous user creation and management flows
- Error reporting and logging enhancements
- Integration points with existing Maestro test infrastructure
