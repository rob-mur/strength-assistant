- Created comprehensive test infrastructure

## Recent Work Completed (Latest Session)

### Integration Tests Restored âœ…
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript mock `__mocks__/expo-router.js` was interfering with web builds
- **Fix Applied**: Replaced with TypeScript mock to prevent build interference
- **Issue**: View wrapper around Stack component broke React Navigation
- **Fix Applied**: Removed problematic View wrapper from `app/_layout.tsx`
- **Result**: Both integration tests now passing (2/2 success rate)

### Unit Tests Fixed âœ…  
- **Issue**: Router mocks weren't consistent across test files
- **Fix Applied**: Created comprehensive TypeScript mock with shared router instance
- **Added**: Stack and Tabs components with Screen properties
- **Result**: All unit tests passing (953/953 success rate)
