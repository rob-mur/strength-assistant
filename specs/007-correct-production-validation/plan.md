# Implementation Plan: Correct Production Validation Workflow

**Branch**: `007-correct-production-validation` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-correct-production-validation/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Correct production validation workflow dependencies to trigger after production APK builds complete, regardless of infrastructure changes. Remove non-existent job dependencies and obsolete debug workflows. Ensure production validation runs when APK is built and optionally when terraform deploys.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: YAML 1.2 (GitHub Actions workflow syntax)  
**Primary Dependencies**: GitHub Actions, existing workflow infrastructure  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: GitHub Actions workflow validation, CI pipeline testing  
**Target Platform**: GitHub-hosted runners (ubuntu-latest)
**Project Type**: CI/CD infrastructure (single project scope)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast workflow execution, minimal CI queue time  
**Constraints**: Must maintain existing production build functionality  
**Scale/Scope**: Multiple workflow files modification (.github/workflows/)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Local Testing First**: ✅ PASS - Workflow changes can be validated locally using GitHub CLI
**Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS - Workflow behavior validation is the test for this infrastructure change
**CI/CD Infrastructure as Code**: ✅ PASS - All workflow changes are version controlled YAML files
**Anonymous User Testing**: ✅ PASS - Not applicable for infrastructure changes
**Progressive Validation**: ✅ PASS - Changes can be validated through workflow execution

**Compliance Status**: CONSTITUTIONAL - All applicable principles satisfied

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - CI/CD infrastructure changes affect repository-level workflows

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts/production-validation-fixed.yml, quickstart.md)
- Contract validation → workflow syntax verification task [P]
- Implementation → modify production-validation.yml workflow file
- File removal → delete test-production-validation.yml workflow
- Quickstart scenarios → validation test tasks
- Simple workflow modification (not complex model/service implementation)

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Validation before modification (verify current state)
- Implementation: Update workflow triggers, remove non-existent dependencies
- File cleanup: Remove debug workflow
- Testing: Execute quickstart scenarios to verify corrections
- Mark [P] for independent validation tasks

**Estimated Output**: 27 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Specific Task Categories**:

1. **Validation Tasks**: Verify current workflow state, syntax checking
2. **Implementation Tasks**: Update workflow triggers, remove bad dependencies
3. **Cleanup Tasks**: Remove obsolete debug workflow
4. **Testing Tasks**: Trigger workflows, verify correct behavior
5. **Verification Tasks**: Execute quickstart scenarios, confirm corrections

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
