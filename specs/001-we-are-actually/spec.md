# Feature Specification: Local First Storage with Backup

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-actually`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We are actually mid-way through this feature but it's the first time writing the specification. What I want to be able to do for this app is to have offline first storage that is synced automatically to a cloud database. The feature we are currently working on is a technical one in that we are migrating from firebase to supabase because of historical issues using supabase. For now the data being stored is super simple, but the difficulty is making sure all of our pipelines/tests/tooling has a good replacement"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the strength assistant app, I need to be able to access and modify my exercise data instantly on my device with all operations performed locally first. For users with accounts, data should be automatically backed up to the cloud and available when setting up new devices, ensuring my data is preserved without impacting the immediate user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am using the app offline, **When** I create, edit, or delete exercise records, **Then** all changes are persisted locally and become available immediately in the app
2. **Given** I have made offline changes and regain internet connectivity, **When** the app detects the connection, **Then** all local changes are automatically synchronized to the cloud database
3. **Given** I use the app on multiple devices, **When** data syncs from any device, **Then** all other devices receive the updated data and display consistent information
4. **Given** there are conflicting changes between local and remote data, **When** synchronization occurs, **Then** the system resolves conflicts using last-write-wins strategy (most recent timestamp takes precedence)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when synchronization fails due to network issues or server errors?
- How does the system handle partial sync failures where only some records sync successfully?
- What happens when the user exceeds storage limits on either local device or cloud database?
- How does the system behave when the cloud database is temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST persist all user data locally on the device for offline access
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect internet connectivity status
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically synchronize local changes to cloud database when connectivity is available
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain data consistency across multiple devices for the same user account
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide immediate feedback to users when data operations (create, read, update, delete) are performed
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle network interruptions gracefully without data loss
- **FR-007**: System MUST migrate existing user data from the current storage solution without data loss
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain all existing app functionality during and after the migration
- **FR-009**: System MUST support two authentication methods: email/password signup for cross-device sync, or anonymous signin for device-local data only
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle synchronization conflicts using last-write-wins strategy based on modification timestamps
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual sync status indication through a small icon showing sync in progress or sync complete
- **FR-012**: Development and testing pipelines MUST function correctly with the new storage solution
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide immediate, snappy user experience on device with no noticeable pauses for data operations (background sync performance is not critical given small data size)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Exercise Records**: User's workout and exercise data that needs to be accessible offline and synced across devices
- **User Account**: Identity that links data across multiple devices and enables cloud synchronization
- **Sync State**: Tracking information for what data has been synchronized and what changes are pending
- **Conflict Records**: Information about data conflicts that arise during synchronization
