# Test: CI-Safe Offline Sync Test
# Purpose: Test offline sync without relying on airplane mode
# 
# This test uses app-controlled network simulation instead of airplane mode
# to work around the Android emulator airplane mode bug in CI environments

- launchApp

# Wait for app to load
- assertVisible:
    id: "workoutTab"

# Navigate to developer settings to control network simulation
- tapOn:
    text: "Settings"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Settings"

# Enable network simulation mode for testing
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element:

- tapOn:

# STEP 1: Force app into offline mode using simulation
- tapOn:

- assertVisible:
    text: "Offline Mode Simulated"

# Navigate to exercises
- tapOn:
    id: "exercisesTab"

# Verify app shows offline status
- assertVisible:
    id: "sync-status-offline"

# STEP 2: Create exercises while app thinks it's offline

# STEP 3: CRITICAL TEST - Restart app while in simulated offline mode
- stopApp
- launchApp

# Navigate back to exercises
- tapOn:

# CRITICAL ASSERTION: Exercises must persist through restart

# Verify sync recovery

- assertVisible:
    text: "CI Safe Test 2"
- assertVisible:

# STEP 5: Final restart test to ensure full recovery
- stopApp
- launchApp

# Final verification
