# Feature Specification: Production Build APK Process/Browser Module Fix

**Feature Branch**: `009-the-production-build`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the production build apk job is failing with error message Cannot find module 'process/browser'. we need to fix it. the PR validation all completed successfully"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Production build pipeline failing due to missing 'process/browser' module
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CI/CD system, production build pipeline
   ‚Üí Actions: Build APK for production release
   ‚Üí Data: Build artifacts, dependencies
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must not break existing PR validation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Error is specific - process/browser module missing]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear flow: production build must succeed without errors
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on build system reliability
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Build pipeline, dependency resolution, APK artifacts
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed, implementation-focused but necessary
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a development team, we need the production build pipeline to successfully generate APK files without module resolution errors, so that we can reliably deploy the application to production environments and app stores.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a production build is triggered, **When** the build system processes dependencies, **Then** all required modules including process/browser must be resolved successfully
2. **Given** the PR validation pipeline passes, **When** the production build runs, **Then** it must also complete successfully with the same dependency configuration
3. **Given** the build completes successfully, **When** the APK is generated, **Then** it must contain all necessary runtime dependencies

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the build system encounters missing Node.js polyfills in production mode?
- How does the system handle differences between development and production dependency resolution?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Production build system MUST successfully resolve all required Node.js modules including process/browser
- **FR-002**: Build pipeline MUST generate valid APK files without module resolution errors
- **FR-003**: Production build configuration MUST maintain compatibility with existing PR validation setup
- **FR-004**: Build system MUST provide clear error messages when dependency resolution fails
- **FR-005**: Production APK MUST include all necessary polyfills and dependencies for runtime execution

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Build Pipeline**: CI/CD system responsible for generating production APK artifacts
- **Dependency Resolution**: System for managing and bundling required modules and polyfills
- **APK Artifact**: Final production build output containing all necessary application code and dependencies
