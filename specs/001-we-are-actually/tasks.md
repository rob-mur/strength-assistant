# Tasks: Local First Storage with Backup

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/rob/Documents/Github/strength-assistant/specs/001-we-are-actually/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA üö®

**BEFORE ANY TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE:**
- **`devbox run test` MUST pass successfully**
- This includes: Package lock validation, TypeScript checks, ESLint, Format checking, Jest tests
- Integration tests can run in CI (due to speed), but all unit tests must pass locally
- No task is complete until all code quality checks pass

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- All tasks must result in `devbox run test` passing

## Path Conventions
- **React Native**: `lib/` for core logic, `app/` for screens, `__tests__/` for tests

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) before all other phases
- Contract tests (T004-T009) before core implementation (T010-T016)
- T010-T012 (models) before T013-T016 (services)
- T013-T016 before T017-T020 (feature flag integration)
- T017-T020 before T021-T025 (UI integration)
- T013-T014 before T026-T029 (auth integration)
- Core implementation before testing (T030-T035)
- Everything before migration & cleanup (T036-T040)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Contract Tests (After Setup)
```bash
# Launch T004-T009 together:
devbox run test -- __tests__/contracts/storage-backend-contract.test.ts
devbox run test -- __tests__/contracts/supabase-auth-contract.test.ts  
devbox run test -- __tests__/contracts/exercise-crud-contract.test.ts
devbox run test -- __tests__/integration/anonymous-local-first.test.ts
devbox run test -- __tests__/integration/auth-cross-device-sync.test.ts
devbox run test -- __tests__/integration/feature-flag-migration.test.ts
```

### Model Creation (After Contract Tests Fail)
```bash
# Launch T010-T012 together:
Task: "Implement ExerciseRecord model with validation in lib/models/ExerciseRecord.ts"
Task: "Implement UserAccount model with auth types in lib/models/UserAccount.ts"
Task: "Implement SyncStateRecord model for sync tracking in lib/models/SyncStateRecord.ts"
```

### UI Hook Updates (After Storage Backend Complete)
```bash
# Launch T021-T023 together:
Task: "Update useExercises hook to use new storage backend in lib/hooks/useExercises.ts"
Task: "Update useAddExercise hook with Legend State integration in lib/hooks/useAddExercise.ts"
Task: "Create sync status indicator component in lib/components/SyncStatusIcon.tsx"
```

## Feature Flag Testing Strategy
**USE_SUPABASE_DATA Environment Variable Control**:
1. Test with `USE_SUPABASE_DATA=false` (Firebase backend)
2. Test with `USE_SUPABASE_DATA=true` (Supabase backend)
3. Validate identical behavior across both modes
4. Test migration between modes

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Use `devbox run` commands for consistency
- Feature flag must work for both true/false states
- Commit after each task
- All tests must use Devbox environment for reproducibility

## Quality Assurance Notes

### Test-First Development Rules
1. **RED Phase**: Each test MUST fail when first written (no implementation exists)
2. **GREEN Phase**: Write minimal code to make test pass  
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Validation**: Run `devbox run test` after each task completion

### Task Completion Requirements
**ONLY mark a task as completed when:**
- All tests pass in `devbox run test`
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- No ESLint violations
- Consistent formatting with Prettier
- Implementation fully satisfies contract requirements

**Never mark complete if:**
- Tests are failing
- Implementation is partial
- Code quality checks fail
- Dependencies are unresolved

### Common Failure Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå Writing implementation before tests
- ‚ùå Declaring task complete without running `devbox run test`
- ‚ùå Accumulating TypeScript or ESLint errors
- ‚ùå Modifying same file in parallel tasks (causes conflicts)
- ‚ùå Skipping the RED phase in TDD cycle

## Final Deliverable Validation

The feature is complete ONLY when:
1. All 40 tasks are marked complete
2. `devbox run test` passes without any failures
3. All three user scenarios from quickstart.md execute successfully
4. Feature flag switching works for both `USE_SUPABASE_DATA=true` and `USE_SUPABASE_DATA=false`
5. No outstanding TypeScript, ESLint, or formatting issues
