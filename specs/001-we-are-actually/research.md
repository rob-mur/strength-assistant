# Research: Local First Storage with Backup

## Legend State + Supabase Integration

**Decision**: Use Legend State as the primary sync engine with Supabase backend
**Rationale**: 
- Legend State provides automatic local persistence with built-in sync capabilities
- Handles offline-first architecture with optimistic updates
- Provides conflict resolution (last-write-wins) out of the box
- Integrates well with React Native and Supabase
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Direct Supabase client with manual local storage (more complex, reinventing sync logic)
- Other sync libraries like WatermelonDB (heavier, more complex for simple data)

## Feature Flag Strategy for Migration

**Decision**: Use runtime feature flags to toggle between Firebase and Supabase implementations
**Rationale**:
- Allows incremental migration with rollback capability
- Enables A/B testing and gradual rollout
- Defines clear interfaces for both storage backends
- Facilitates testing both implementations in parallel
**Alternatives considered**:
- Hard cutover migration (risky, no rollback)
- Build-time flags (less flexible for testing and rollout)

## Authentication Migration Approach

**Decision**: Implement Supabase authentication alongside Firebase with feature flag control
**Rationale**:
- Allows testing both auth systems independently
- Enables gradual user migration
- Maintains existing user sessions during transition
- Supports both email/password and anonymous authentication patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- Immediate auth system replacement (high risk, potential user disruption)
- User migration scripts (complex, potential data loss)

## Testing Strategy for Dual-Backend Support

**Decision**: Comprehensive test suite covering both Firebase and Supabase implementations
**Rationale**:
- Ensures functional parity between implementations
- Validates feature flag switching behavior
- Confirms data migration integrity
- Enables confident Firebase removal after validation
**Test Coverage Areas**:
- Unit tests for data layer interfaces
- Integration tests for both backends
- E2E tests with feature flag scenarios
- Migration tests for data consistency

## Data Migration and Consistency

**Decision**: Real-time migration with consistency validation
**Rationale**:
- Minimizes user disruption
- Ensures data integrity during transition
- Allows validation of migration success
- Supports rollback if issues arise
**Implementation Approach**:
- Background sync from Firebase to Supabase
- Consistency checks during dual-write period
- User-level migration tracking
- Automated rollback triggers if inconsistencies detected

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Local-first operations with background sync optimization
**Rationale**:
- Maintains immediate UI responsiveness requirement
- Background sync doesn't impact user experience
- Small data size makes sync performance non-critical
- Legend State handles sync queuing and batching automatically
**Optimization Areas**:
- Batch sync operations where possible
- Intelligent sync scheduling (when app backgrounded)
- Network condition awareness for sync timing
- Minimal payload optimization for faster transfers

## Development Environment Reproducibility

**Decision**: Use Devbox (Nix) for dependency management
**Rationale**:
- Ensures identical development environment across team members
- Lock file guarantees exact same dependencies in CI and local development
- Eliminates "works on my machine" issues during migration testing
- Version pinning critical for testing both Firebase and Supabase integrations
**Benefits for Migration**:
- Consistent testing environment across Firebase/Supabase implementations
- Reliable CI pipeline for feature flag testing scenarios
- Reproducible builds for deployment confidence
- Easy environment switching for different migration phases
**Alternatives considered**:
- Standard npm/yarn (less reproducible, version drift issues)
- Docker (heavier overhead, slower development cycle)
- Standalone dependency management (manual version coordination)
