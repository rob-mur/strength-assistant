# Feature Specification: Email Verification Redirect Fix

**Feature Branch**: `013-fix-signin-redirect`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "fix signin flow: creating an account doesnt currently work because the redirect url returns to a webpage that doesnt exist. whilst this is expected on the web (we havent yet deployed the web version) the android app shoupd redirect back to the app on verifying email"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Android Account Creation with Email Verification (Priority: P1)

A new user creates an account on the Android app and successfully verifies their email address, returning directly to the app to complete their registration and start using the application.

**Why this priority**: This is the core broken functionality preventing new user acquisition on Android. Without this fix, users cannot complete account creation, making it the highest priority to restore basic app functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new account on Android, receiving verification email, clicking the link, and confirming the user returns to the app instead of a broken webpage. Delivers the fundamental value of allowing users to complete registration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user on Android opens the app, **When** they create an account with valid email and password, **Then** they receive an email verification link that redirects back to the app upon clicking
2. **Given** a user has clicked the email verification link, **When** the redirect occurs, **Then** they are returned to the app with their account verified and can proceed with app usage
3. **Given** a user creates an account and verifies their email, **When** they return to the app, **Then** their account status is properly updated and they have full access to app features

### User Story 2 - Failed Email Verification Recovery (Priority: P2)

A user who experiences issues with email verification (expired link, multiple clicks, network issues) can still complete their account creation through alternative means or clear error messaging.

**Why this priority**: Handles edge cases that could still block user onboarding, ensuring a robust signup experience for users with non-standard verification scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various failure scenarios (expired links, offline verification attempts) and confirming users receive helpful guidance to complete registration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user clicks an expired verification link (after 24 hours), **When** they are redirected, **Then** they receive clear messaging about the expired link and instructions to request a new one
2. **Given** a user clicks a verification link multiple times, **When** subsequent clicks occur, **Then** they are handled gracefully without errors and the user's verified status is maintained

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user clicks verification link while app is not installed? → Redirect to web fallback page with account verification
- How does system handle verification link clicks when app is backgrounded or closed?
- What occurs if user clicks verification link from a different device than where they created the account? → Allow verification and automatically sync to all user devices
- How does system respond to malformed or tampered verification URLs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST redirect Android users to the app after successful email verification instead of to a web page
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle deep linking to return users to the main dashboard/home screen with them automatically signed in after verification
- **FR-003**: System MUST update user account status to verified when email verification redirect occurs
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain separate redirect behavior for web users (current webpage redirect) and Android users (app redirect)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle verification link clicks gracefully when the app is not currently running
- **FR-007**: System MUST redirect to a web fallback page with account verification when the app is not installed
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve user session and authentication state during the verification redirect process
- **FR-008**: System MUST support cross-device verification and automatically sync verified status to all user devices

### Key Entities

- **User Account**: Email address, verification status, platform type (Android/web), authentication state
- **Verification Token**: Unique identifier linking email verification to specific user account, 24-hour expiration time, redirect target configuration

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of Android users who click email verification links are redirected to the app instead of a broken webpage
- **SC-002**: Users can complete the full account creation process from signup to verified account within 5 minutes
- **SC-003**: Email verification completion rate for Android users increases to match industry standards (>85%)
- **SC-004**: Zero support tickets related to broken email verification links after deployment

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: When users click the email verification link and are redirected back to the Android app, which specific screen should they land on? → A: Main dashboard/home screen with them signed in
- Q: What should happen when a user clicks the email verification link but the Android app is not installed on their device? → A: Redirect directly to a web fallback page with account verification
- Q: How long should email verification links remain valid before expiring? → A: 24 hours
- Q: What should happen when a user clicks the verification link from a different device than where they created the account? → A: Allow verification and automatically sync to all user devices

## Assumptions

- Current email verification system supports configurable redirect URLs for different platforms
- Android app can handle incoming links from external sources or this capability can be added
- Web redirect behavior should remain unchanged until web deployment is ready
- Users have email access and can receive verification emails successfully
