# Feature Specification: Fix Android Integration Test Bug

**Feature Branch**: `010-fix-android-integration`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fix android integration test bug: Currently, the integration android tests are passing according to the script but in reality each of the maestro fails is failing. There is some improper exit code handling which is causing it to report a success. We need to fix the script and then fix the underlying issue causing the failures, which is almost certainly an eas environment variable misconfiguration during the build step. Note that this needs to be validated fixed in the integration test case and the production validation"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Fix Android integration test reporting and underlying failures
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CI/CD system, developers, test scripts, Maestro tests
   ‚Üí Actions: Execute tests, report results, validate production builds
   ‚Üí Data: Test results, exit codes, environment variables
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must fix both reporting and underlying test failures
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Identified: Supabase environment variables likely misconfigured in EAS
   ‚Üí Identified: CI should crash when any Maestro test flows fail
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Run tests ‚Üí Get accurate results ‚Üí Fix underlying issues
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on test accuracy and validation
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Test scripts, exit codes, environment variables, build configurations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific EAS configuration"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer or CI/CD system, I need to run Android integration tests and receive accurate pass/fail results so that I can confidently deploy code changes and identify real issues in the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the Android integration test script is executed, **When** all Maestro tests pass, **Then** the script reports success with exit code 0
2. **Given** the Android integration test script is executed, **When** any Maestro test fails, **Then** the script reports failure with non-zero exit code and clear error details
3. **Given** a production Android build is created, **When** integration tests are run against it, **Then** all tests pass and validate the production environment correctly
4. **Given** EAS environment variables are properly configured, **When** the Android build is created, **Then** the resulting APK contains the correct configuration for testing

### Edge Cases

- **Exit Code Inversion Bug**: When GitHub Actions receives exit code 0 (success) but reports `success=0` (falsy), causing successful tests to appear failed in CI dashboards
- **Partial Test Suite Failures**: When some Maestro tests pass but others fail, the system must fail-fast and report the first failure with complete debug artifacts
- **Environment Variable Mismatch**: When EAS production builds use incorrect Supabase URLs, causing runtime connection failures that only manifest during integration testing
- **Android Emulator Networking**: When local development works but Android emulator cannot reach host Supabase instance due to incorrect networking configuration (10.0.2.2 vs 127.0.0.1)
- **Build Profile Configuration Conflicts**: When preview/development builds incorrectly attempt to use EAS environment variables instead of devbox configuration, causing build-time failures

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Test execution scripts MUST accurately report the actual status of all Maestro test runs and handle exit codes properly to prevent false positive results
- **FR-002**: System MUST return non-zero exit codes when any integration test fails and CI system MUST crash and halt execution when any Maestro test flow fails
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide clear error messages and logs when tests fail, including specific failure details and debug artifact locations
- **FR-004**: Android builds MUST be configured with correct environment variables for both testing and production validation
- **FR-005**: Integration test validation MUST work consistently across both test and production build environments
- **FR-006**: System MUST configure Supabase environment variables correctly in EAS build process (see env_vars.md for specific values per environment)

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Test Script**: Controls test execution and result reporting, manages exit codes and error handling
- **Maestro Tests**: Individual test cases that validate Android application functionality
- **Exit Codes**: Numeric indicators of test success/failure that must accurately reflect test outcomes
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values needed for proper build and test execution
- **Build Configuration**: EAS settings that determine how the Android APK is constructed for testing
