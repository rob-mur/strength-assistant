# Research: Android Integration Test Bug Fix

## Investigation Summary

Research focused on understanding the current Android integration testing infrastructure and identifying the root causes of false positive test reporting and underlying test failures.

## Key Findings

### 1. Critical Exit Code Bug Identified

**Location**: `.github/actions/maestro-test/action.yml` lines 62-66

**Current Code**:
```yaml
echo "success=$TEST_EXIT_CODE" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**Problem**: The `success` output is set to the exit code (0/1) instead of boolean (true/false), causing inverted success reporting:
- Successful tests: `success=0` (falsy) → reported as failed
- Failed tests: `success=1` (truthy) → reported as successful

**Decision**: Fix the exit code handling to properly convert to boolean
**Rationale**: This is the primary cause of false positive test reporting
**Alternatives considered**: Modifying downstream consumers vs fixing at source - chose fixing at source for clarity

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration Patterns

**Decision**: Use environment-specific configuration strategy
**Rationale**: Different environments (dev/preview/production) require different Supabase configurations

**Current Pattern**:
- **Production**: Uses EAS environment variables (`eas env:set`)
- **Development/Preview**: Uses devbox configuration files
- **Android Testing**: Requires special emulator networking (`10.0.2.2:54321`)

**Alternatives considered**: Unified configuration vs environment-specific - chose environment-specific to maintain isolation

### 3. Test Infrastructure Architecture

**Decision**: Maintain current Maestro test structure with improved exit code handling
**Rationale**: Infrastructure is well-designed with comprehensive debugging and logging

**Current Structure**:
- Maestro tests in `.maestro/android/` directory
- Test execution script: `scripts/integration_test_android.sh`
- GitHub Actions for automated execution
- Comprehensive debug artifact collection

**Alternatives considered**: Replacing test framework vs fixing existing - chose fixing existing due to solid foundation

### 4. EAS Build Configuration Analysis

**Decision**: Maintain current build profile strategy with corrected environment variable usage
**Rationale**: Current structure properly isolates environments but needs EAS environment variable fixes

**Current Profiles**:
- **development**: No EAS env vars (uses devbox)
- **preview**: No EAS env vars (uses devbox)
- **production**: Uses EAS environment variables

**Alternatives considered**: Unifying all builds to use EAS env vars vs current approach - chose current approach to maintain dev/CI isolation

## Required Environment Variables

Based on `env_vars.md` and current configuration analysis:

### All Environments
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Authentication key for Supabase
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_SUPABASE`: Feature flag (true)
- `FIREBASE_WEB_CONFIG`: Legacy configuration (masked)
- `GOOGLE_SERVICES`: Google services configuration (masked)

### Production Environment
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: `https://oddphoddejomqiyctctq.supabase.co`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATOR`: `false`

### Development/Preview Environment
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATOR`: `true`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_SUPABASE_EMULATOR`: `true`
- Special Android emulator networking configuration

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Exit Code Fix
- Modify `.github/actions/maestro-test/action.yml` to properly convert exit codes to boolean
- Ensure downstream GitHub Actions workflows correctly interpret success/failure
- Test fix in both local devbox and CI environments

### Environment Variable Validation
- Verify EAS environment variables are set for production builds
- Confirm Android emulator networking works with Supabase
- Validate environment variable loading in each build profile

### Testing Validation
- Run integration tests locally with devbox
- Verify tests fail when they should fail
- Confirm production validation works with corrected configuration

## Next Phase Dependencies

Phase 1 design will focus on:
1. Specific GitHub Actions workflow modifications
2. EAS environment variable configuration steps
3. Test validation procedures
4. Rollback and validation strategies
