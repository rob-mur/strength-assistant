# React Native Cross-Platform Migration Tasks

## Overview

Migration plan to replace custom platform-specific implementations with modern React Native cross-platform libraries. This will eliminate 12+ platform files, remove require() calls, and simplify the architecture.

## Current State Analysis

### Files to be Removed/Replaced

- `lib/utils/platform/deviceInfo.ts` (6 files total)
- `lib/utils/platform/deviceInfo.native.ts`
- `lib/utils/platform/deviceInfo.web.ts`
- `lib/utils/platform/toast.ts` (6 files total)
- `lib/utils/platform/toast.native.ts`
- `lib/utils/platform/toast.web.ts`
- `lib/utils/platform/alert.ts` (6 files total)
- `lib/utils/platform/alert.native.ts`
- `lib/utils/platform/alert.web.ts`

### Files to be Modified

- `lib/utils/logging/DefaultUserErrorDisplay.ts` (uses platformAlert, platformToast)
- `lib/utils/logging/ReactNativeContextCollector.ts` (uses device info)
- `lib/utils/logging/LoggingServiceFactory.ts` (has toast detection logic)
- `lib/utils/platform/index.ts` (exports platform modules)

### Current Dependencies to Remove

- Manual platform detection in LoggingServiceFactory
- require() calls for optional dependencies
- Complex platform-specific implementations

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Device Information Migration (Low Risk)

**Target**: Replace device info platform files with Expo SDK
**Libraries**: expo-device, expo-application, expo-constants (already available)
**Impact**: Remove 3 files, simplify device context collection

### Phase 2: Toast Notifications Migration (Medium Risk)

**Target**: Replace toast platform files with react-native-toast-notifications
**Libraries**: react-native-toast-notifications
**Impact**: Remove 3 files, eliminate factory detection logic

### Phase 3: Alert Dialogs Migration (Medium Risk)

**Target**: Replace alert platform files with react-native-paper-alerts
**Libraries**: react-native-paper-alerts
**Impact**: Remove 3 files, better web UX

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Low Risk)

**Target**: Remove unused platform infrastructure
**Impact**: Clean up factory logic, update imports

# 🚨 CRITICAL: Production-Blocking Test Issues - URGENT FIX REQUIRED

**Current Status**: ❌ **NOT PRODUCTION READY** - Multiple critical test failures and hanging tests

## Critical Issues Overview

### Jest Hanging Issues ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED

- **Status**: Jest hanging partially resolved but still occurring in contract tests
- **Impact**: CI/CD pipeline will timeout and fail
- **Root Causes Identified**:
  - ✅ Timer cleanup implemented but insufficient
  - ✅ Event listener cleanup added
  - ❌ Contract tests still hanging due to complex async operations
  - ❌ ExerciseService global persistence causing infinite loops
  - ❌ TestDevice initialization blocking test execution

### Contract Test Failures 🔴 CRITICAL

**Impact**: 39+ test failures blocking production deployment

#### 1. Exercise CRUD Contract Test (**tests**/contracts/exercise-crud-contract.test.ts)

- **Status**: FAILING - Timeout after 15s
- **Root Cause**: ExerciseService.clearAll() method hanging in global.testPersistence
- **Line**: Line 172 - "should mark previously synced exercise as pending after update"
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH - Core functionality testing

#### 2. Test Infrastructure Contract (**tests**/contracts/test-infrastructure.test.ts)

- **Status**: FAILING - Multiple timeout failures
- **Root Cause**: TestDevice.cleanup() method taking >15s
- **Lines**: Lines 79, 155, 174, 200 - Multiple test methods timing out
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH - Test infrastructure critical for all testing

#### 3. Storage Backend Contract (**tests**/contracts/storage-backend-contract.test.ts)

- **Status**: FAILING - Timeout after 15s
- **Root Cause**: SupabaseStorage operations hanging
- **Line**: Line 71 - "should update an exercise"
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH - Core data layer testing

#### 4. Supabase Auth Contract (**tests**/contracts/supabase-auth-contract.test.ts)

- **Status**: FAILING - Assertion failures + timeouts
- **Root Causes**:
  - Anonymous user ID generation not unique (line 96)
  - Auth state subscription cleanup hanging (line 158)
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH - Authentication critical for production

## Immediate Action Items (Production Blockers)

### Phase 1: Fix Jest Hanging Issues (ETA: 2-4 hours)

  - Priority: 🔴 HIGH

### Phase 3: Implement Proper Test Architecture (ETA: 2-3 hours)

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Add contract test timeout controls
  - Action: Implement per-test timeout overrides for complex operations
  - File: All contract test files
  - Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Add test isolation improvements

## Success Criteria for Production Readiness

### ✅ Required for Production Deployment:

1. **Zero test failures** - All tests must pass
2. **Zero hanging tests** - All tests must complete within timeout limits
3. **Jest exits cleanly** - No "force exit" warnings
4. **Contract tests enabled** - All .skip() calls removed
5. **CI/CD compatibility** - Tests run successfully in automated environments

### 📊 Performance Targets:

- **Individual test timeout**: <15s (currently failing)
- **Full test suite**: <10 minutes (currently timing out)
- **Jest exit time**: <5s after completion (currently requires force exit)

## Risk Assessment

### 🔴 HIGH RISK - Production Deployment Blocked

- Contract tests are core functionality validation
- Multiple critical paths failing (auth, storage, CRUD operations)
- Jest hanging will break CI/CD pipelines
- Current state would cause production deployment failures

### ⚠️ Recommended Action

**STOP** all non-test-related development until these issues are resolved. The current test failures indicate potential runtime issues that could affect production stability.
