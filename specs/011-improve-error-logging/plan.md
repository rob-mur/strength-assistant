# Implementation Plan: Improve Error Logging and Handling

**Branch**: `011-improve-error-logging` | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-improve-error-logging/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Systematic replacement of 47 empty catch blocks throughout the codebase with proper error logging, user feedback, and recovery mechanisms. Implementation includes centralized logging service with severity classification, automatic retry for transient errors, and consistent error handling patterns across all environments.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with React Native/Expo (React 19.0.0, RN 0.79.5)
**Primary Dependencies**: Expo SDK 53, Supabase, Legend State, Jest, Maestro, React Native Testing Library
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Local AsyncStorage, In-memory error event buffer
**Testing**: Jest (unit tests), Maestro (integration), React Native Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Mobile (iOS/Android) + Web support via Expo
**Project Type**: Mobile - uses lib/ and app/ structure per constitutional requirements
**Performance Goals**: <1ms error logging overhead, <2MB memory footprint for error handling
**Constraints**: No breaking changes, maintain existing functionality, consistent across all environments
**Scale/Scope**: 148 TypeScript files, 47 empty catch blocks identified, mobile-first performance requirements

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Initial Constitution Check: PASS ✅

**I. Local Testing First**: All error handling changes will be tested locally using devbox before CI/CD. Devbox environment ensures reproducible testing across development stages.

**II. Test-Driven Development**: Contract tests defined before implementation. Error handling paths will have comprehensive unit tests. Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all error handling components.

**III. CI/CD Infrastructure as Code**: No changes to CI/CD workflows required. Build processes maintain devbox consistency.

**IV. Anonymous User Testing**: Error handling preserves anonymous user patterns. No persistent test data in error logs. User session design maintains test isolation.

**V. Progressive Validation**: Development follows unit tests → integration tests → production validation → deployment pattern. Error handling tested at each stage.

### Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS ✅

**Architecture Compliance**:
- Business logic in lib/utils/logging/ (constitutional requirement)
- Direct framework usage - no heavy abstractions over React Native error handling
- Supabase-only for any remote logging (future enhancement)
- Test coverage for all error handling paths

**No Constitutional Violations**: All changes align with established patterns and principles.

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 3 (Mobile + API) - React Native/Expo application with Supabase backend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved ✅ COMPLETED

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file ✅ COMPLETED

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

1. **Contract Test Tasks** (Priority: High):
   - LoggingService contract test implementation [P]
   - ErrorHandler contract test implementation [P]
   - UserErrorDisplay contract test implementation [P]
   - ErrorMigrationService contract test implementation [P]

2. **Core Infrastructure Tasks** (Priority: High):
   - Create DefaultLoggingService implementation
   - Create DefaultErrorHandler with global error boundaries
   - Create DefaultUserErrorDisplay for React Native
   - Create LoggingServiceFactory

3. **Migration Service Tasks** (Priority: Medium):
   - Implement ErrorMigrationService for scanning catch blocks
   - Implement CodeAnalysisService for context extraction
   - Create migration templates for different error types

4. **Empty Catch Block Migration Tasks** (Priority: Critical to Low):
   - **Critical Priority**: Storage operations (asyncStorage.web.ts)
   - **High Priority**: Database operations (SupabaseExerciseRepo.ts, SupabaseAuth.ts)
   - **Medium Priority**: Sync operations (syncConfig.ts), Service operations (ExerciseService.ts)
   - **Low Priority**: Test utilities and development helpers

5. **Integration Tasks** (Priority: Medium):
   - Set up global error boundary in app entry point
   - Configure recovery actions for each error type
   - Implement error context collection
   - Add user error messaging integration

6. **Validation Tasks** (Priority: High):
   - Performance impact validation tests
   - Memory usage validation tests
   - Error recovery scenario integration tests
   - End-to-end error handling flow tests

**Ordering Strategy**:

- **TDD Pattern**: Contract tests → Implementation → Integration tests
- **Dependency Order**: Core services → Migration tools → Actual migrations → Integration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Critical catch blocks first (data integrity), then high-priority (user-facing)
- **Parallel Execution [P]**: Independent contract tests, non-overlapping file migrations

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Task Categories**:
- Contract Tests: 4 tasks [P]
- Core Implementation: 8 tasks
- Migration Infrastructure: 6 tasks
- Empty Catch Block Fixes: 20 tasks (grouped by priority)
- Integration & Setup: 4 tasks
- Validation & Testing: 6 tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
