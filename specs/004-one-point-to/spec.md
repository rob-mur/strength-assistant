# Feature Specification: Production Server Testing Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `004-one-point-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "one point to add to the spec - i would like these production tests to be tan against the actual production server so we have the exact configuration used. they should obviously only run once everything else in the pipeline has passed, and should be compartmentalised to use a test user etc"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Enhancement to existing production testing to use actual production server
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CI/CD pipeline, test users, production server
   ‚Üí Actions: run production tests, validate configuration, compartmentalize test data
   ‚Üí Data: test user credentials, production server endpoints, pipeline stages
   ‚Üí Constraints: run only after all other tests pass, isolated test environment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Tests will reuse existing Maestro integration test flows
   ‚Üí Fresh anonymous users eliminate need for data cleanup
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Pipeline flow: other tests pass ‚Üí production tests run ‚Üí deployment approved
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Production server connectivity, test user management, pipeline integration
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Test users, production endpoints, pipeline stages, test results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific test scope and cleanup procedures"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: Which specific application functionality should be tested against production? ‚Üí A: Same Maestro flow files used for integration testing
- Q: What timeout limits should production tests have? ‚Üí A: No specific requirement, tests should be relatively fast
- Q: How should test user data be isolated/cleaned up? ‚Üí A: Use fresh anonymous user each time, no data cleanup needed
- Q: Would you prefer the simpler APK-based approach over the comprehensive service architecture? ‚Üí A: Simple APK approach: Build production APK, run existing Maestro flows, use env var to modify clear emulator script
- Q: For the APK-based approach, which environment variable should control the anonymous user creation behavior? ‚Üí A: SKIP_DATA_CLEANUP (tests already use anonymous users by default)
- Q: Should production tests run as post-deployment validation rather than pre-deployment gates? ‚Üí A: Post-deployment validation: Run after terraform deploy, trigger rollback on failure
- Q: What should happen when production validation fails after infrastructure is already deployed? ‚Üí A: Manual intervention: Alert team, block frontend deploy, require manual rollback decision

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Development teams need to validate that their applications work correctly with the actual production server configuration before deployment, ensuring that any environment-specific issues are caught in the CI/CD pipeline rather than discovered by end users.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** infrastructure has been deployed via terraform, **When** the production validation stage runs, **Then** tests execute against the actual deployed production infrastructure using a production APK build
2. **Given** production tests are running, **When** they access production services, **Then** they use the exact same endpoints, certificates, and configurations that real users would encounter
3. **Given** production tests complete successfully, **When** the deployment process continues, **Then** frontend deployment is approved with confidence in production compatibility
4. **Given** production tests fail, **When** the pipeline evaluates the results, **Then** team is alerted, frontend deployment is blocked, and manual rollback decision is required
5. **Given** existing Maestro flows run with SKIP_DATA_CLEANUP=true, **When** tests complete, **Then** no additional cleanup is required as anonymous users are already handled by default

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the production server is temporarily unavailable during test execution?
- How does the system handle rate limiting or security restrictions when running tests against production?
- What occurs if anonymous user creation fails during test execution?
- How are production test failures distinguished from temporary infrastructure issues?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Production validation tests MUST run after infrastructure deployment (terraform) but before frontend deployment
- **FR-002**: Production tests MUST connect to and validate against the actual deployed production infrastructure and configuration
- **FR-003**: Production APK MUST be built with production configuration to ensure exact environment matching
- **FR-004**: Pipeline MUST run existing Maestro integration test flows against the production APK build
- **FR-005**: SKIP_DATA_CLEANUP environment variable MUST control emulator clearing behavior since tests already use anonymous users by default
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear separation between test user activities and real user activities in production logs and metrics
- **FR-007**: Pipeline MUST alert development team and block frontend deployment if production validation tests fail, requiring manual rollback decision
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle production server rate limiting and security restrictions without causing false failures
- **FR-009**: Production test execution MUST complete within reasonable timeframes as tests are designed to be relatively fast
- **FR-010**: Fresh anonymous users MUST be created through standard app flows rather than external service management

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Anonymous Test Users**: Fresh anonymous user accounts created for each test run, eliminating data persistence and cleanup concerns
- **Production Endpoints**: The actual production server URLs, API endpoints, and service configurations used by real users
- **Pipeline Stage Results**: Test outcomes, execution logs, and validation status from the production testing phase
- **Test Execution Results**: Detailed validation outcomes, error logs, and performance metrics from Maestro test flows executed against production server (distinct from user account management)
- **Deployment Gates**: Pipeline checkpoints that prevent release if production validation fails
