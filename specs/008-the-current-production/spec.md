# Feature Specification: Fix Production APK Download Failure

**Feature Branch**: `008-the-current-production`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the current production validation github actions workflow is failing because it is unable to download the production apk, even though the apk successfully built and released. this issue is to fix that"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Production validation workflow failing to download APK despite successful build
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: workflow failure, APK download issue, GitHub releases mismatch
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: APK builds successfully but validation fails on download
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer who pushes code to main branch, I want the production validation workflow to successfully download and test the APK that was built and released, so that I can have confidence in the production deployment without manual intervention or workflow failures.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a production APK has been successfully built and released to GitHub releases, **When** the production validation workflow runs, **Then** it should successfully download the APK and proceed with testing
2. **Given** multiple APK files exist in GitHub releases, **When** the production validation workflow runs, **Then** it should download the correct APK from the latest release
3. **Given** the production validation workflow attempts to download an APK, **When** the download fails due to network issues, **Then** it should retry with appropriate backoff and provide clear error messages
4. **Given** a GitHub release exists but contains no APK files, **When** the production validation workflow runs, **Then** it should fail with a clear error message indicating the missing APK
5. **Given** the APK download succeeds but the file is corrupted, **When** the production validation workflow validates the file, **Then** it should detect the corruption and fail with appropriate error details

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitHub release exists but APK file has unexpected naming convention?
- How does system handle when multiple APKs exist in the same release?
- What occurs when GitHub API rate limits prevent APK download?
- How does workflow behave when GITHUB_TOKEN lacks necessary permissions?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Production validation workflow MUST successfully download APK files from GitHub releases when they exist
- **FR-002**: System MUST correctly identify and download the APK file from the latest GitHub release
- **FR-003**: Download process MUST include retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate APK file integrity after download (file size, format, corruption check)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear, actionable error messages when APK download fails
- **FR-006**: Workflow MUST handle various APK file naming patterns that may be used in releases
- **FR-007**: System MUST verify GITHUB_TOKEN permissions are sufficient for release asset access
- **FR-008**: Download process MUST be compatible with the GitHub release structure created by the build workflow
- **FR-009**: System MUST distinguish between "no releases exist" and "release exists but no APK" scenarios

### Key Entities

- **GitHub Release**: Container for APK files created by the build workflow
- **APK File**: Android application package that needs to be downloaded and validated
- **Production Validation Workflow**: CI/CD process that downloads and tests the APK
- **GitHub Release Asset**: The actual APK file attached to a GitHub release
- **Download Retry Logic**: Mechanism to handle transient download failures
