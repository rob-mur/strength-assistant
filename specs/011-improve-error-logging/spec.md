# Feature Specification: Improve Error Logging and Handling

**Feature Branch**: `011-improve-error-logging`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "improve error logging and handling: throighout the codebase there are a lot of empty try catches which cause errors to be silently ignored. at the very least these shouod be logged or better yet the error properly addressed"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature focuses on improving error handling across codebase
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, users experiencing silent failures
   ‚Üí Actions: identify silent error handling, add logging, improve error recovery
   ‚Üí Data: error logs, diagnostic information
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain existing functionality while improving observability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific error types to prioritize]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: logging level preferences and destinations]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: developer can identify and debug application issues
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Error detection, logging, and handling improvements
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Error events, log entries, diagnostic context
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focuses on observable behavior and error handling policies
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: What error severity classification should be used? ‚Üí A: Standard: Critical, Error, Warning, Info, Debug
- Q: How should user-facing errors be communicated? ‚Üí A: Generic user facing error for unhandled errors, logged in background for developers
- Q: What should determine error recovery strategy? ‚Üí A: Errors should only be retried if there's reasonable expectation they are transient i.e. network errors. Other errors are bugs and should be logged/shown
- Q: What contextual data should be included in error logs? ‚Üí A: Standard: timestamp, error message, stack trace plus user ID, operation, app state
- Q: Should error handling behavior differ between development and production? ‚Üí A: Same behavior: consistent logging across all environments

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer maintaining the strength-assistant application, I need to be able to identify and diagnose issues when they occur, rather than having errors silently ignored, so that I can maintain application reliability and provide better user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an error occurs in any part of the application, **When** the error is caught by existing try-catch blocks, **Then** the error details must be logged with sufficient context for debugging
2. **Given** a silent error occurs that previously would be ignored, **When** reviewing application logs, **Then** the error event and relevant context must be visible in the logs
3. **Given** an error occurs during critical user operations, **When** the error can be recovered from, **Then** the system should attempt recovery while still logging the incident
4. **Given** an error occurs that cannot be recovered from, **When** the error is handled, **Then** the user should receive appropriate feedback rather than silent failure

### Edge Cases

- What happens when logging itself fails or is unavailable?
- How does the system handle cascading errors during error handling?
- What level of detail should be logged for different types of errors?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST log all caught errors with standard diagnostic context: timestamp, error message, stack trace, user ID, current operation, and relevant application state
- **FR-002**: System MUST eliminate silent error handling where errors are caught but completely ignored
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide generic user-friendly error messages for unhandled errors while logging detailed technical information in background for developer access
- **FR-004**: System MUST attempt error recovery only for transient errors (network, I/O) with reasonable expectation of success; logic errors and bugs must be logged and reported without retry
- **FR-005**: System MUST include contextual information in error logs as defined in FR-001 standard diagnostic context
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle logging failures gracefully without causing additional errors
- **FR-007**: System MUST categorize errors by severity level using standard classification: Critical (system failures), Error (operation failures), Warning (potential issues), Info (general events), Debug (diagnostic details)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide consistent error handling patterns across the codebase and maintain identical behavior across all environments (development, staging, production)
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve existing application functionality while improving error visibility

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Error Event**: Represents an exception or error condition, containing message, stack trace, timestamp, and context
- **Log Entry**: Structured record of an error event with metadata for debugging and monitoring
- **Error Context**: Additional information about application state when error occurred (user session, operation in progress, etc.)
- **Recovery Action**: Defined response to specific error types that attempts to restore normal operation
