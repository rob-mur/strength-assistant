# Feature Specification: Android Production Stack Overflow Bug Fix

**Feature Branch**: `012-production-bug-android`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "production bug android: there is a bug in the production android build which didn't get picked up in CI. In particular, there is a message saying 'maximum call stack size reached', likely due to logging. In this branch we need to identify the cause, as the production validation MR job passed fine, without this issue being present (it's only present on real devices) and then fix it"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Production Android app crashes with "maximum call stack size reached"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users on real Android devices
   ‚Üí Actions: App usage causing stack overflow crash
   ‚Üí Data: Error logging system potentially causing recursive calls
   ‚Üí Constraints: Bug only appears on real devices, not in CI validation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific user actions that trigger the crash]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Frequency of occurrence - all users or specific scenarios]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User opens production app and experiences crash
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on eliminating stack overflow
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Error logs, Stack traces, Logging service calls
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Focus on stability and reliability requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an end user with the production Android app installed on my device, I need the app to function without crashing so that I can complete my intended tasks without interruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has the production Android app installed on a real device, **When** they open and use the app normally, **Then** the app should not crash with "maximum call stack size reached" error
2. **Given** the app is performing background operations or logging, **When** multiple operations occur simultaneously, **Then** the logging system should not cause recursive calls leading to stack overflow
3. **Given** the production validation tests pass in CI, **When** the same build is deployed to real devices, **Then** the behavior should be consistent without additional crashes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the app handles multiple concurrent error scenarios?
- How does the system behave when logging operations are nested deeply?
- What occurs when device memory is constrained during logging operations?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST prevent stack overflow errors that cause application crashes on real Android devices
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure logging operations do not create recursive call chains
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain consistent behavior between CI validation environment and real device deployment
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide reliable error handling that does not compromise application stability
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow normal app functionality without crash interruptions

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Error Logs**: Records of application errors and their context, must not cause recursive logging
- **Stack Traces**: Call chain information that helps identify recursive patterns
- **Logging Service**: Error reporting mechanism that must operate without stack overflow risk
