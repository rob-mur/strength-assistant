# Feature Specification: Consolidate Production Deployment Workflows

**Feature Branch**: `009-the-production-validation`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the production validation build currently fails in production because the test script is looking for an apk called build_preview.apk which is incorrect for prod tests. also, the flow of the on push to main workflows is unecessarily complicated because they are separate workflows. i would like to consolidate them into one with separate jobs for build prod apk, deploy terraform and production validation"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What should happen when concurrent pushes to main occur during an active deployment? → A: Cancel
- Q: What should the correct production APK filename be? → A: build_production.apk
- Q: How long should the workflow wait before timing out during deployment operations? → A: No timeout

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Production validation fails due to incorrect APK filename (build_preview.apk vs prod)
   → Multiple separate workflows on push to main create complexity
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: workflow consolidation, APK naming correction, job sequencing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: Push to main triggers unified deployment pipeline
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer who pushes code to the main branch, I want a single, streamlined deployment workflow that builds the production APK, deploys infrastructure, and validates the deployment using the correct production APK file, so that I can have confidence in the deployment process without complexity from multiple separate workflows or incorrect test configurations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** code is pushed to the main branch, **When** the deployment workflow triggers, **Then** it should execute build, deploy, and validation as sequential jobs in a single workflow
2. **Given** the production APK build job completes successfully, **When** the validation job runs, **Then** it should test against build_production.apk (not build_preview.apk)
3. **Given** the terraform deployment job completes successfully, **When** the production validation job runs, **Then** it should validate against the actual deployed infrastructure
4. **Given** any job in the deployment workflow fails, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** subsequent dependent jobs should not execute and the workflow should provide clear failure diagnostics
5. **Given** the deployment workflow completes successfully, **When** all jobs pass, **Then** the production environment should be ready with validated APK and infrastructure
6. **Given** a new commit is pushed to main during an active deployment, **When** the new push occurs, **Then** the running deployment should be cancelled and a new deployment should start with the latest commit
7. **Given** deployment operations are running, **When** they encounter complex scenarios, **Then** they should continue running until completion or manual cancellation without automatic timeouts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the APK build succeeds but terraform deployment fails?
- How does the system handle partial deployment states where some jobs complete but others fail?
- What occurs when the production validation tests pass but with warnings about infrastructure issues?
- How does the workflow handle concurrent pushes to main during an active deployment? (Resolved: cancel running deployment, start new one)
- How are long-running deployment operations handled? (Resolved: no automatic timeouts, run until completion)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST consolidate build production APK, terraform deployment, and production validation into a single workflow triggered by push to main
- **FR-002**: Production validation job MUST use build_production.apk filename (not build_preview.apk)
- **FR-003**: Workflow MUST sequence jobs with proper dependencies (build before deploy, deploy before validation)
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure production validation tests run against the actual deployed infrastructure
- **FR-005**: Workflow MUST provide clear status and failure reporting for each job
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent partial deployments by stopping dependent jobs when prerequisites fail
- **FR-007**: Workflow MUST maintain the same security and access controls as current separate workflows
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing APK build artifacts and terraform state management
- **FR-009**: Production validation MUST use anonymous user testing approach for clean test isolation
- **FR-010**: System MUST cancel any running deployment when a new push to main occurs and start a fresh deployment with the latest commit
- **FR-011**: Workflow MUST allow deployment operations to run until completion without automatic timeouts, terminating only on failure or manual cancellation

### Key Entities

- **Unified Deployment Workflow**: Single workflow that orchestrates all production deployment activities
- **Production APK Build Job**: Builds and uploads build_production.apk with correct naming
- **Terraform Deployment Job**: Deploys infrastructure changes to production environment
- **Production Validation Job**: Tests the deployed system using build_production.apk
- **Job Dependencies**: Relationships that ensure proper sequencing and failure handling
- **Workflow Artifacts**: APK files, terraform state, and validation results passed between jobs
- **Deployment Cancellation**: Mechanism to terminate running deployments when new commits are pushed
