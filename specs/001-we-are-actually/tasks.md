## Dependencies (Sequential Chain)
```
Critical: T001 (TypeScript fixes) → ALL OTHER TASKS
Contracts: T001 → T002 → T003 → T004 → T005
Implementation: T005 → T006 → T007 → T008 → T009
Optimization: T009 → T010 → T011 → T012 → T013
Enforcement: T009 → T014 → T015 → T016 → T017
Learning: T009 → T018 → T019 → T020
Documentation: T020 → T021 → T022 → T023
Final: T023 → T024 → T025 → T026
```

## Parallel Example
```bash
# After T001 is complete, launch contract tests together:
Task: "Contract test for Constitutional Amendment v2.6.0 in __tests__/contracts/constitutional-amendment-v260.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for Task Completion Template validation in __tests__/contracts/task-completion-template.test.ts" 
Task: "Contract test for Test Performance monitoring in __tests__/contracts/test-performance-monitoring.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for Constitutional Integration in __tests__/contracts/constitutional-integration-v260.test.ts"
```

## Constitutional Success Criteria (Amendment v2.6.0)
- [ ] `devbox run test; echo "Exit code: $?"` returns exit code 0 consistently
- [ ] **Test execution completes in <60 seconds** (constitutional performance requirement)
- [ ] All task completions include mandatory test expectation declarations
- [ ] Post-task validation execution documented for every task
- [ ] Prediction accuracy tracking operational and improving over time
- [ ] Constitutional compliance monitoring active and reporting
- [ ] Zero test skips without constitutional justification
- [ ] Integration with Amendments v2.5.0 and v2.4.0 fully functional

## Constitutional Amendment v2.6.0 Compliance Protocol
**Task Completion Validation**: Every task completion MUST include:
1. **Test Expectation Declaration**: "Expected Test Outcome: [PASS/FAIL] - [Reasoning]"
2. **Validation Execution**: Execute `devbox run test; echo "Exit code: $?"`
3. **Results Documentation**: Document actual results vs prediction
4. **Performance Tracking**: Record execution time vs 60-second target
5. **Learning Integration**: Note prediction accuracy for continuous improvement

## Critical Notes
- **T001 is BLOCKING**: TypeScript compilation errors must be resolved before any other work
- **TDD Required**: All contract tests (T002-T005) must fail before implementation
- **Sequential Execution**: Memory management requires one task at a time
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Amendment v2.6.0 format required for every task completion
- **Performance Priority**: <60 second test execution is constitutional requirement

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Constitutional Contracts**: 4 contract files → 4 contract test tasks (T002-T005)
2. **From Amendment Requirements**: Core implementation → 4 implementation tasks (T006-T009)
3. **From Performance Requirements**: Optimization → 4 performance tasks (T010-T013)
4. **From Enforcement Needs**: Automation → 4 enforcement tasks (T014-T017)
5. **From Learning Requirements**: Analytics → 3 learning tasks (T018-T020)
6. **From Documentation Needs**: Updates → 3 documentation tasks (T021-T023)
7. **From Validation Requirements**: Final validation → 3 validation tasks (T024-T026)

**TOTAL TASKS**: 26 sequential tasks
**ESTIMATED DURATION**: 15-20 hours (with constitutional compliance validation)
**CRITICAL PATH**: T001 (TypeScript fixes) → T002-T005 (contracts) → T006-T009 (implementation) → T024-T026 (validation)
