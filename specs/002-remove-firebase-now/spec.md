# Feature Specification: Complete Firebase Removal

**Feature Branch**: `002-remove-firebase-now`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "remove firebase - now we have built the tooling to use supabase and i have checked the implementation, what we now need to do is remove any and all reference to firebase. that means no firestore, auth, test infra, packages etc"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature requires complete removal of Firebase infrastructure ‚úì
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: Firebase packages, Firestore, Auth, test infrastructure, configuration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined - complete removal specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: system continues working with Supabase only ‚úì
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific ‚úì
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Package dependencies, configuration files, source code modules
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí No implementation details in requirements ‚úì
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a system maintainer, I want to completely remove all Firebase dependencies from the codebase so that the application runs exclusively on Supabase infrastructure, reducing complexity, maintenance overhead, and potential security risks from unused dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the application currently has both Firebase and Supabase implementations, **When** Firebase components are removed, **Then** the application continues to function normally using only Supabase
2. **Given** Firebase packages are installed in package.json, **When** they are removed, **Then** the application builds and runs without dependency errors
3. **Given** Firebase authentication and storage code exists, **When** it is removed, **Then** all authentication and data operations work through Supabase only
4. **Given** Firebase test infrastructure exists, **When** it is removed, **Then** all tests pass using Supabase test implementations
5. **Given** Firebase configuration files exist, **When** they are removed, **Then** the application configuration is clean and Firebase-free

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Firebase-specific environment variables are removed?
- How does the system handle removal of Firebase mock implementations in tests?
- What occurs when Firebase-specific CI/CD configuration is eliminated?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all Firebase npm package dependencies from package.json
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove all Firebase configuration files (firebase.json, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove all Firebase source code modules and implementations
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove all Firebase test infrastructure and mock implementations
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove all Firebase authentication code and dependencies
- **FR-006**: System MUST remove all Firebase Firestore database code and dependencies
- **FR-007**: System MUST remove all Firebase-related environment variables and configuration
- **FR-008**: System MUST remove all Firebase-related CI/CD pipeline configurations
- **FR-009**: System MUST remove all Firebase import statements and references from source code
- **FR-010**: Application MUST continue to function normally after Firebase removal using only Supabase
- **FR-011**: All existing tests MUST pass after Firebase components are removed
- **FR-012**: Build process MUST complete successfully without Firebase dependencies

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Firebase Packages**: npm dependencies including @react-native-firebase/app, @react-native-firebase/auth, @react-native-firebase/firestore, firebase
- **Firebase Configuration**: firebase.json and related configuration files
- **Firebase Source Modules**: lib/data/firebase/ directory and all Firebase implementation files
- **Firebase Test Infrastructure**: Firebase mock factories, test utilities, and Firebase-specific test cases
- **Firebase References**: Import statements, environment variables, and code references to Firebase throughout the codebase
