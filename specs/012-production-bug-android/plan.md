# Implementation Plan: Android Production Stack Overflow Bug Fix

**Branch**: `012-production-bug-android` | **Date**: 2025-10-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-production-bug-android/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Primary requirement: Fix "maximum call stack size reached" error occurring in production Android builds but not detected in CI. Technical approach involves analyzing the error logging system for recursive call patterns and implementing stack overflow prevention mechanisms.

User input: "please take a look around the codebase for possible culprits and come up with several theories with associated tests for how we could check"

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript with React Native/Expo SDK  
**Primary Dependencies**: React Native, Expo, Supabase, Legend State  
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), local Legend State  
**Testing**: Jest (unit), Maestro (integration), React Native Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Android production devices  
**Project Type**: mobile - React Native app with API backend  
**Performance Goals**: No stack overflow crashes, <1ms logging overhead  
**Constraints**: Production environment only bug, CI tests pass  
**Scale/Scope**: Production users, complex error logging system with 47 catch block migrations

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**I. Local Testing First**: ✅ PASS - Bug fix can be tested locally with devbox, will validate with local Android emulator before CI
**II. Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS - Will write tests for recursive call detection before implementing fixes
**III. CI/CD Infrastructure as Code**: ✅ PASS - No CI/CD changes required, using existing devbox workflows
**IV. Anonymous User Testing**: ✅ PASS - Bug affects production users, testing will use anonymous test users
**V. Progressive Validation**: ✅ PASS - Following pattern: unit tests → integration tests → production validation → deployment

**Overall**: ✅ CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE VERIFIED

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Create contract tests for each interface in stack-overflow-detection.ts [P]
- Create unit tests for each entity in data-model.md [P]
- Implementation tasks for stack overflow detection components
- Integration tasks to enhance existing error handling system

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Contract tests → Unit tests → Implementation → Integration
- Safety order: Tests first → Simple components → Remove complex system → Maestro integration
- Dependency order: Core components → App integration → Test updates → Validation
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent test/implementation tasks)

**Specific Task Areas**:

1. **Error Blocking System Tests** [P]
   - ErrorBlockerState contract tests
   - SimpleErrorLogger contract tests
   - MaestroErrorDetection contract tests
   - ErrorBlockingFactory contract tests

2. **Core Implementation** [P]
   - ErrorBlocker React component
   - SimpleErrorLogger implementation
   - React Native ErrorUtils integration
   - Maestro test helper utilities

3. **System Removal & Replacement**
   - Remove DefaultErrorHandler.ts (750+ lines)
   - Remove complex LoggingServiceFactory
   - Replace complex error handling usage throughout codebase
   - Update app/_layout.tsx with ErrorBlocker

4. **Maestro Integration & Testing**
   - Add error detection to existing Maestro flows
   - Create error simulation test scenarios
   - Production APK error detection validation
   - Performance comparison testing

**Estimated Output**: 15-18 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on simple error blocking

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
